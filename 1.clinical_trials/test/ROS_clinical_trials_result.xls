ROS	Completed	A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of BRL 49653C in Non-insulin Dependent Diabetes	Diabetes Mellitus Non Insulin Dependent Oral Agent Therapy	Drug: BRL 49653C;   Drug: Placebo	                Phase 3              	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01706211?term=ROS&rank=5	NCT01706211	At least 30% of patients initially treated with sulphonylureas for NIDOM will have a poor response, and in the remaining 70% the subsequent failure rate is approximately 4% to 5% per year. BRL 49653C has a different mechanism of action to the sulphonylureas, and therefore the effects on fasting plasma glucose and Hb A1c are expected to be additive. Since circulatory insulin levels should decrease, and plasma glucose should be regulated, these combinations are also anticipated to slow both the progression of diabetic complications and delay the need for exogenous insulin.  The proposed study is intended primarily to determine the effectiveness of BRL 49653C by measure of glucose homeostasis as determined by Hb A1c and fasting plasma glucose, when added to sulphonylurea therapy (sulphonylureas are limited to: glibenclamide, glipazide and gliclazide). In addition, the clinical safety of BRL 49653C will be assessed in this patient population. The starting doses have been selected based on dose response studies examining safety, tolerability and efficacy in the U.S.A.

ROS	Recruiting	Reactive Oxygen Species Following Aortic Valve Replacement	Aortic Stenosis		zoe.nicholas@uhs.nhs.ukCentro Cardiovascular, Hospital San Borja, Chile	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02841917?term=ROS&rank=2	NCT02841917	Surgical aortic valve replacement (SVAR) is currently the 'Gold Standard' therapy for patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS). Approximately 30-50% of patients with severe AS are deemed inoperable due to comorbidities such as severe respiratory disease, chronic renal disease and peripheral vascular disease. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a novel therapeutic modality for inoperable patients and an effective alternative to SAVR in selected high and intermediate-risk patients. Myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury (MRI), mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), related to cardiopulmonary bypass has been linked to adverse clinical outcomes following cardiac surgery. In contrast to SAVR, transcatheter deployment of aortic prostheses requires shorter time of ischemia and hypotension and may be associated with less ROS mediated MRI. Inflammatory responses and reperfusion injury following TAVR have not been previously described nor compared to SAVR. The aim of this study is therefore to compare the oxidative stress response in patients with isolated severe symptomatic AS undergoing SAVR or TAVR and determine whether it correlates with clinical outcomes.

A phase II study looks at how effective a medication is at treating a specific type of cancer and collects information on the side effects of the study treatment.  RET, ROS1, or NTRK fusion or increased MET or AXL activity gene leads to lung cancer cell growth. Cabozantinib is an oral medicine that inhibits of RET, ROS1, NTRK, MET, and AXL. In addition, this drug interferes with other cell pathways that also cause cancer cells to grow, form new blood vessels, and spread to other organs of the body. The goal of using cabozantinib is to shrink the cancer and to prevent it from growing  Cabozantinib has been studied and shown to cause cancer shrinkage in other cancers such as medullary thyroid cancer and prostate cancer.

The disease is caused partly by environmental and partly by genetic factors. It is well known that the fat content of the bone marrow is increased in osteoporotic patients. Animal studies suggest that stimulation of bone marrow stem cells through the molecule PPARgamma with the drug rosiglitazone converts the stem cells to fat cells instead of bone cells thereby decreasing bone strength. In a single study healthy volunteers were treated with rosiglitazone for 14 weeks and had a decrease in bone mineral density.  In the present study we wish to investigate the effect of this treatment on bone and fat tissue. 25 women above the age of 60 will be treated with rosiglitazone 8 mg/day for 14 weeks and compared with 25 women receiving placebo.  The effect will be evaluated as follows:      The effect on bone marrow density will be examined by a bone scan prior to and after treatment and again after 6 and 9 months.    The effect on bone turnover will be measured in blood- and urine samples at the same times.    The effect on fat distribution will be evaluated by an MRI scan after treatment.    The effect on bone marrow cells will be investigated bone marrow sampling immediately after treatment    The direct effect on fat will be examined by a biopsy immediately after treatment The study hypothesis is that rosiglitazone treatment decreases bone mineral density and increases bone marrow fat content.

The physiological stressors of hypoxia and hypercapnia will be utilized to elicit increases in cerebral blood flow (CBF), and intravenously infused drugs will allow for the testing of potential mechanisms of cerebrovascular control. Specifically, the contributions of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), cyclooxygenase (COX), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) to hypoxic and hypercapnic increases in CBF will be examined. The concept that these mechanisms interact in a compensatory fashion to ensure adequate CBF during both hypoxia and hypercapnia will also be tested.  ~25 young, healthy men and women will be tested at rest and during hypoxia and hypercapnia. Subjects will participate in two randomized, counterbalanced study visits under the following conditions: inhibition of NOS, NOS-COX, and NOS-COX-ROS or inhibition of COX, COX-NOS, COX-NOS-ROS. During hypoxia, arterial oxygen saturation will be lowered to 80% and end-tidal carbon dioxide will be maintained at basal levels. During hypercapnia arterial carbon dioxide will be increased ~10 mmHg above basal levels and arterial oxygen saturation will be maintained.

It is hypothesized that both NOS and COX independently contribute to hypoxic and hypercapnic vasodilation in the MCA and BA, combined NOS-COX contribute to hypoxic and hypercapnic vasodilation in MCA and BA to a greater extent than either NOS or COX alone, and NOS-COX-ROS contribute to hypoxic and hypercapnic vasodilation in the MCA and BA to a greater extent than NOS-COX.

This study will also assess the synergistic effect of Rosiglitazone and Fenofibrate on the same parameters.

ROS	Unknown  	Clinical Relevance of ROS (V-ros UR2 Sarcoma Virus Oncogene Homolog) Aberrations in Solid Tumours	Cancer			https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01596374?term=ROS&rank=31	NCT01596374	Alterations involving the ROS (v-ros UR2 sarcoma virus oncogene homolog 1) gene such as mutations, overexpression and gene rearrangements has been implicated in carcinogenesis and has been demonstrated to be a relevant target for ALK inhibitors. While emerging reports have demonstrated the role of ROS rearrangement in non-small cell lung cancer and cholangiocarcinoma, the functional significance of ROS dysregulation in solid tumors remain largely unstudied. The investigators aims are: (1) To characterize the frequency of ROS gene fusion, ROS protein overexpression and ROS gene mutations in cell lines and tumors from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal, gastric, breast, ovarian, cholangiocarcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer, (2) To identify novel ROS gene variants in human solid tumors harboring ROS aberrations using next generation sequencing (NGS), (3) To determine the functional relevance of novel ROS gene variants identified with NGS, (4) To characterize the sensitivity of cells with functionally relevant ROS aberrations using ROS tyrosine kinase inhibitors. ROS fusions and protein overexpression will be screened in a panel of cell lines and primary tumors using Fluorescence In-situ Hybridization and immunohistochemistry respectively. Targeted next-generation sequencing will be applied to identify ROS variants in matching cancer types demonstrating high levels of gene fusion and protein overexpression. Functional characterization of novel ROS variants will be performed by silencing (shRNA) and overexpressing candidate cell lines with the respective ROS mutations/fusions, and evaluating their effects on biological functions including cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis, as well as sensitivity against ROS/ALK inhibitors. The investigators anticipate findings from this study will improve the investigators understanding of aberrant ROS signaling in an expanded group of cancer types, and potentially identifying a larger group of cancer patients that will benefit from ROS targeted therapy.  Further insight of the role of ROS receptor tyrosine kinase will confirm it as a therapeutic target in human solid tumors and hence expand the indication of crizotinib and other dual ALK/ ROS inhibitors. Furthermore, given the rarity of ROS fusion receptor tyrosine kinase in reported cancers, defining the epidemiology of ROS aberrations in other unreported cancers harboring ROS pathway activation is essential to properly design future clinical trials of ROS inhibitors. The validation of ROS receptor tyrosine kinase will also provide a new therapeutic target in the treatment of cancer and expand the role of novel targeted agents. Findings from this study will further the investigators knowledge on the oncogenic functions of the ROS and the application of ROS inhibitors in an extended group of solid tumors.

Troglitazone has been shown by abdominal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to reduce the intra-abdominal adipose tissue area in type 2 diabetics. Similarly rosiglitazone has also been shown to increase subcutaneous but not intra-abdominal fat in patients with type 2 diabetes. In the same study it was also shown to cause a substantial reduction in hepatic fat. Central fat depots are believed to be associated with more cardiovascular risk than subcutaneous fat depots. By contrast, sulphonylurea-associated weight gain has been shown by abdominal CT scan to include increases in intra-abdominal adipose tissue.  The aim of this study is to compare the body fat distribution pattern of glibenclamide plus rosiglitazone versus glibenclamide and placebo (especially the intra-abdominal adipose tissue and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue areas) in patients with type 2 diabetes. It is hypothesised that rosiglitazone will lead to the accumulation of excess energy stores in the subcutaneous rather than the intra-abdominal adipose tissue depot. In addition, it is hoped that by having a positive effect on diastolic blood pressure, lipid levels, BMI, rosiglitazone will be shown to have a better cardiovascular risk profile when used in combination with glibenclamide rather than when glibenclamide is used alone.  Although insulin resistance has been shown to be a primary defect causing type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin secretory defect has also been known to be an important factor in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A previous study has shown that in Korean patients, early-phase insulin secretory defect may be the initial abnormality in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus [56].  This study also aims to assess the efficacy and safety of glibenclamide plus rosiglitazone versus glibenclamide plus placebo therapy in Korean patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition, a previous study has shown that in Korean patients, early-phase insulin secretory defect may be the initial abnormality in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study aims to show that rosiglitazone treatment in Korean patients, regardless of their early phase insulin secretory ability, is just as efficacious and safe.  Objective(s) Primary To evaluate the effect of 12 months oral treatment with glibenclamide plus rosiglitazone versus oral glibenclamide plus placebo, on body fat distribution (as measured by the change in the ratio between the intra-abdominal adipose tissue and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue areas) in patients with type 2 diabetes.  Secondary      To investigate the efficacy of glibenclamide plus rosiglitazone, compared to glibenclamide plus placebo on beta-cell function and insulin resistance as calculated by HOMA-B and HOMA-R.

One of the side effects, however, is the fact that subjects treated with these drugs seem to be more prone to fluid retention. The precise mechanism of rosiglitazone-related fluid retention is unknown, but it is clear that either primary or secondary renal sodium retention is part of the mechanism. Furthermore in observational studies, TZD-related oedema seems to be resistant to loop diuretic therapy. The recent finding that rosiglitazone induces upregulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the kidney could be the explanation for TZD-related fluid retention and the observed resistance to loop diuretics. In the present human in-vivo study the following hypothesis will be tested:  Rosiglitazone treatment stimulates the activity of ENaC in the distal nephron, which enhances the natriuretic effect of amiloride and decreases the natriuretic effect of furosemide in parallel.

In patients with atherosclerosis, endothelial function is impaired. Excess production of reactive oxygen species (free radicals) contribute to endothelial dysfunction in atherosclerosis, and some prior studies have shown a beneficial effect of antioxidant treatment on endothelial function in patients with coronary artery disease. On the other hand, reactive oxygen species may be required for normal endothelial function and antioxidant supplements failed to show a benefit in large clinical trials. The effect of antioxidant treatment on endothelial function in healthy subjects is unknown. The present study will test the hypothesis that scavenging reactive species might reduce endothelium-dependent vasodilation in healthy subjects.  The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Participants will receive 2.4 grams of oral NAC or similar-appearing placebo during the first visit, and then will cross over to the alternative treatment (NAC or placebo) for the second and final visit.

Background:  Diabetic nephropathy is a world wide public health concern of increasing proportions. It has become the most common single cause of end-stage renal disease in the United States and in Europe. Previous studies have already found agents modifying the renin-angiotensin-system (ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blocker) to retard diabetic nephropathy. These agents are likely to exert multiple effects in the kidney. One of them appear to be their known ability to improve endothelial function and to change renal glomerular hemodynamics.  In a previous study we demonstrated an improvement of renal endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetic patients without end organ damage after treatment with rosiglitazone. In that study, rosiglitazone significantly reduced glomerular hyperfiltration. This was associated with a reduction of urinary albumin excretion. The observed effects are potentially important in the context of renal protection, provided that a similar beneficial effect of rosiglitazone is demonstrable in overt diabetic nephropathy (renal insufficiency, hypertension, proteinuria).  Hypothesis Rosiglitazone decreases proteinuria and improves renal hemodynamic function in patients with chronic renal insufficiency due to overt diabetic nephropathy.

ROS	Recruiting	The Production of Reactive Oxygen Species in Response to Glutathione Supplementation and Acute Exercise	Type 2 Diabetes;   Oxidative Stress;   Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species Production	Dietary Supplement: Glutathione;   Other: Placebo	ssoendergaard@sund.ku.dk	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02948673?term=ROS&rank=95	NCT02948673	Objectives: The research focus of the study is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in response to glutathione (GSH) supplementation and in response to acute exercise.  Oxidative stress is suggested as a possible causative factor in the pathophysiology of skeletal muscle insulin resistance. GSH is the most abundant endogenous antioxidant in the cell and thus, a crucial protector against oxidative stress and insulin resistance. It has been found that patients with T2D have a decreased level of GSH in plasma and that 1 h GSH infusion improves skeletal muscle glucose uptake by ~25% and the redox environment in patients with T2D. Therefore, we want to investigate the effect of 3 months of GSH supplementation on skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial ROS production in patients with T2D and healthy controls.  Hypothesis: Oral GSH supplementation will improve skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity in patients with T2D and this effect will be linked to a reduced mitochondrial ROS production in the skeletal muscle.  In contrast to the link between oxidative stress and insulin resistance, ROS produced in response to exercise is an important physiological stimulus as it is suggested to play a key role in the beneficial mitochondrial biogenesis observed in response to training. It has been reported that some patients with T2D have a diminished mitochondrial biogenesis in response to training, but the reason for this defect is not known. We want to investigate the link between exercise-stimulated ROS production and the mitochondrial biogenesis response in patients with T2D and healthy controls in response to acute exercise at two different intensities.  Hypothesis: Considering the pathological condition of T2D skeletal muscle (i.e. high chronic ROS level), we speculate that a lower exercise intensity, leading to a lower exercise-stimulated ROS production is a more optimal stimulus (i.e. not to high) for mitochondrial biogenesis in patients with T2D.

RSG XR, the investigational drug, is an extended-release form of RSG. This study tests whether RSG XR safely provides benefit to people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). RSG XR is a new approach to AD therapy and this study tests whether one's genes alter the effectiveness of RSG XR. Glucose is used by cells to make energy that they need to live. Changes in the ability of cells to use of glucose can lead to diseases like diabetes. Glucose levels may be lower in the brains of AD patients, and their brain cells may also use glucose less well than in unaffected people. The proper function of brain cells may be critical to memory and thought. If brain cells use glucose poorly, this might impact AD. Drugs that help brain cells properly use glucose may help a person maintain normal memory and thinking. Data suggesting that RSG may help AD patients was first seen in a small study at the Univ. of Washington and then from a larger international GSK study. In the first study, those receiving RSG once daily for 6 months scored better on 3 tests of memory and thought than those who did not receive RSG. In the GSK study, those that benefited most from therapy with RSG XR had a specific genetic pattern. They lacked the gene that caused them to produce apolipoprotein E e4 (APOE e4). Subjects who have the APOE e4 gene may have two copies, one from each parent, or they may have only one APOE e4 gene meaning that they inherited either the APOE e2 or APOE e3 version of the gene from one parent. Subjects with one copy of the APOE e4 gene remained fairly stable while those with two copies of APOE e4 continued to worsen during the 6-month treatment. This study will directly test the effect of RSG XR on people who either have or lack the APOE e4 gene.

According to recent Canadian Diabetes Association guidelines glucose control, based on the A1C measurement, needs to be achieved within a 6-12 month period of time after the initial diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. The guidelines on the use of antihyperglycemic agents identify the potential benefits of sub-maximal oral combination therapy in order to achieve more rapid and improved glycemic control compared with higher dose monotherapy. Furthermore, many patients on prolonged oral antihyperglycemic monotherapy who then start on combination therapy may not achieve the required target glycemic control. Indeed early initiation of combination therapies may be necessary to achieve and maintain glycemic targets because of the progressive deterioration of pancreatic ¦Â cell function and glycemic control.

In kidney transplant patients with chronic rejection these abnormalities cluster with renal and cardiovascular risk factors and altogether may sustain premature graft loss and may increase the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Thiozolidinediones are a new class of oral antidiabetic agents that may increase insulin sensitivity improving the glucose tolerance and dyslipidemia. Moreover, rosiglitazone ¨Cone of these drugs- has been reported to decrease blood pressure and albuminuria in subjects with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy. Recent finding that glitazones ameliorate the glucidic and lipidic profile induced by steroid treatment in healthy subjects, provided a further rationale to evaluate the metabolic and renal effects of glitazones in renal transplant patients on chronic steroid therapy. Thus, we designed and organized a pilot study to assess the short-term risk/benefit profile of rosiglitazone in renal transplant patients with chronic rejection. Ten patients will have a basal evaluation of insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance,lipid profile, renal hemodynamic and albuminuria. These evaluations will be repeated at the end of the treatment (4 months of therapy with rosiglitazone 8 mg/day) period and 2 months after treatment withdrawal.

ROS	Completed	Rosiglitazone (Extended Release Tablets) As Adjunctive Therapy For Subjects With Mild To Moderate Alzheimer's Disease	Alzheimer's Disease	Drug: Rosiglitazone Extended Release 2mg;   Drug: Rosiglitazone Extended Release 8mg;   Other: Placebo;   Other: Donepezil		https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00348309?term=ROS&rank=111	NCT00348309	Rosiglitazone (RSG) has been tested in clinical studies and is approved by the FDA as a treatment for type II diabetes mellitus, a disease that occurs when the body is unable to effectively use glucose. RSG XR, the investigational drug used in this study, is an extended-release form of RSG.  This study tests whether RSG XR safely provides clinical benefit to people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) when combined with the currently approved AD medication, Aricept (donepezil). RSG XR is a new approach to AD therapy and this study tests a new way to treat AD by testing whether one's genetic makeup affects their response to the study drug. Clinical data suggesting that RSG may benefit AD patients was first seen in a small study performed at the University of Washington and then from a larger GSK study conducted in Europe and New Zealand. In the first study, subjects receiving RSG once daily for 6 months scored significantly better on 3 tests of memory and thought than those who did not receive RSG. In the GSK study, those that appeared to benefit most from treatment with RSG XR had a specific genetic pattern. They did not have the gene that caused them to produce the protein apolipoprotein E e4 (APOE e4). Subjects who have the APOE e4 gene may have two copies, one from each parent, or they may have only one APOE e4 gene meaning that they inherited either the APOE e2 or APOE e3 version of the gene, instead of APOE e4, from one of their parents. Subjects with one copy of the APOE e4 gene remained at their same level of thinking ability while those with two copies of the APOE e4 gene, continued to worsen during the 6-month treatment. The current study will more directly test the effectiveness or RSG XR on people who either have or lack the APOE e4 gene.

ROS	Terminated	Ross Aortic Valve Replacement Patients	Congenital Disorders			https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00267995?term=ROS&rank=110	NCT00267995	The Ross procedure has become the surgery of choice for aortic valve replacement in children. This consists of taking a child's own pulmonary valve (the autograft) and replacing the child's diseased aortic valve with the autograft. At times, this can involve either enlarging or reducing the diameter of the aortic annulus to make the valve fit properly. The patient's own pulmonary valve is then replaced, most typically with a human heart valve (a homograft). There has been some concern in the literature that as time goes on, the autograft will dilate and the patient will develop progressive aortic insufficiency.  Since 1994, we have performed almost 50 Ross procedures in children and young adults. Contrary to many reports from the literature, we have not recognized a problem with autograft enlargement and progressive aortic insufficiency. One thing that we have done differently from other centers is that we have modified the insertion technique of the autograft into the native aortic root. This involves a second buttressing suture layer. Not only does this have the immediate effect of reducing bleeding complications, we postulate that it has the long-term effect of stabilizing the autograft and preventing aortic root dilatation.  We hypothesize that this proximal buttressing technique for the Ross procedure has a two-fold benefit. Firstly, it reduces the amount of bleeding in the postoperative period. Secondly, it prevents late autograft root dilatation.

The study will evaluate effects of a unique carbohydrate modified diet alone and in combination with metformin(MF) and Avandamet  (MF plus rosiglitazone (RSG)) on insulin levels in a wide range of ethnically diverse women (aged 35-55) at three academic medical centers. The primary study hypothesis is that insulin sensitizing medications, in combination with alterations in carbohydrate intake, will reduce insulin levels and improve established risk factors for the metabolic syndrome.  The alarming prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and related comorbidities and the paucity of easily adopted, cost-effective preventive strategies for high risk populations, suggest that pharmaco-therapies and dietary regimens targeted to reducing insulin resistance could have important clinical and public health implications.

ROS	Completed	Assessment of Complementary Feeding of Canadian Infants	Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species;   Intestinal Inflammation	Other: Iron fortified cereal;   Other: Iron fortified cereal with fruit;   Other: Meat		https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01790542?term=ROS&rank=130	NCT01790542	With the recent recommendation from Health Canada to extend exclusive breast-feeding to 6 months of age there has arisen concern about what is the best solid food to introduce at that time. Traditionally solids were introduced in Canada at 4-6 months and usually iron-fortified rice cereal was the first food of choice. New recommendations from Health Canada include meat as a potential first food as well as other iron fortified foods. This has lead to uncertainty of both public health officials and parents about the optimal introduction and choice of solids after exclusive breastfeeding.  In addition to meeting iron needs with the first solid food choice, the investigators are concerned about the possible generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the gut of the infant fed traditional iron fortified cereals. Infant cereals are fortified at 25-30 mg iron per 100 g dry-weight. Absorption of the non-heme electrolytic iron ranges from 5-10% so that most of the residual iron enters the colon. Normally excess iron is sequestered by a variety of mechanisms in the body, but there is no such system for the sequestering of iron in the gut lumen. The investigators have shown that providing iron supplements to adults where the majority of the iron is unabsorbed passes through the digestive tract can lead to the generation of ROS in the colon. These effects are seen in adults receiving 1 mg/kg/day supplemental iron. By 5-6 months of age infants consuming iron fortified cereals will receive the same dose and are likely producing ROS in their digestive tract. This may cause inflammation and make infants more susceptible to disease. The investigators think that meats and infant cereals with phenolic antioxidants available from fruits will likely reduce the generation of ROS in vivo. Therefore the investigators wish to determine if traditional and newly recommended first foods are safe from a free radical and inflammatory perspective.  HYPOTHESES:      Consumption of infant cereals with iron will increase ROS generation in the gut    Consumption of infant cereals with iron and fruit will decrease ROS in the gut    Consumption of meat will not generate ROS    Consumption of iron fortified cereals or meat will maintain iron status during infancy  	Canada, Manitoba || University of Manitoba || Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, R3T6C5	[]	Assessment of Complementary Feeding of Canadian Infants

Adequate control of blood glucose is essential to prevent long term kidney and eye complications that result in kidney failure and blindness. Adolescence is a time when diabetes is difficult to control, due in part to high growth hormone levels causing insulin resistance ( a state where the body does not respond as strongly to insulin). This study will test whether treatment with rosiglitazone (an oral medication used frequently in type 2 diabetes) will reduce the insulin resistance of adolescence and improve the control of type 1 diabetes during puberty.

ROS	Withdrawn	Effect of Cardiac Computed Tomography Angiography on the Blood Reactive Oxygen Species Level	Radiation Injury			https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00815230?term=ROS&rank=156	NCT00815230	The clinically widely used X-ray computed tomography examination has a low-grade radiation effect and recently has attracted much attention concerning the possible adverse effects of radiation on human body [ref. 1-5]. The radiation is harmful to human tissues and cells mainly because it can interact with water (which makes up to 80% of cells) to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially the formation of hydroxyl radicals. So far as we can reach, there is no report concerning the relation between X-ray computed tomography examination and the blood ROS level. Therefore, we wish to conduct this study to clarify if the cardiac computed tomography angiography (cardiac CTA) may induce a higher level of ROS in the peripheral blood.  Study subjects will be OPD patients who are arranged for cardiac CTA examination because of suspect coronary artery disease (CAD). In total, twenty cases will be enrolled for the study. The formal consent will be delivered and explained to the patients and families after the arrangement of cardiac CTA. It then will be retrieved just before the performance of cardiac CTA.  For each enrolled case, peripheral blood will be sampled three times (once before and twice after the performance of cardiac CTA). Totally 60 blood samples will be collected from 20 study subjects within 3 months (January 1 ~ March 31, 2009). ROS level in the collected blood samples will be then measured, compared, and analyzed.

ROS	Completed	Rosiglitazone to Reverse Metabolic Defects in Diabetes	Diabetes Mellitus, Type II;   Insulin Resistance	Procedure: Exercise cardiopulmonary metabolic testing;   Procedure: Skeletal muscle biopsy;   Procedure: Brachial artery reactivity testing	                Phase 2              	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00094796?term=ROS&rank=149	NCT00094796	This study will examine whether the anti-diabetes medicine rosiglitazone can safely and effectively reverse the early problems of type 2 diabetes and delay the onset of disease in people with pre-diabetes. The underlying problem in people with diabetes or pre-diabetes is insulin resistance (lowered sensitivity to insulin) resulting in poor glucose (sugar) regulation. Rosiglitazone improves the body's sensitivity to insulin.  Patients 21 years of age and older who have type 2 diabetes or who are pre-diabetic (glucose intolerant/insulin resistant) may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood tests, echocardiography (heart ultrasound), exercise test, brachial artery reactivity test (see below), and possibly a muscle biopsy.  Participants take one rosiglitazone tablet daily by mouth for 2 weeks. The dose is then increased to two tablets daily for another 2 weeks and then to 4 tablets daily for the remainder of the 12-week treatment period. In addition to treatment, patients undergo the following tests and procedures:      Resting and exercise metabolic testing: The amount of oxygen taken in and carbon dioxide exhaled during breathing is measured while the patient rests in a chair and then while he or she exercises on a stationary bicycle or treadmill. Both at rest and during exercise, the patient wears a facemask that measures the amount of oxygen used. During exercise, heart rate is monitored with electrodes on the chest, arms, and thighs. The exercise test is repeated three times, once to become familiar with the test, again the next day to measure exercise capacity, and again 3 days later. The third test is less strenuous and is optional.    Muscle biopsy (optional): A small area of skin over a calf muscle is numbed with a local anesthetic and a 1-inch incision is made over the muscle. A small amount of muscle tissue is taken and the incision is closed with stitches.    Brachial reactivity study: This ultrasound study tests how well the patient's arteries widen. The subject rests on a bed for 30 minutes. An ultrasound measuring device is placed over the artery just above the elbow. The size of the artery and blood flow through it are measured before and after inflating a pressure cuff around the forearm. The pressure cuff stops the flow of blood to the arm for a few minutes. After a 15-minute rest, a nitroglycerin tablet (medicine that causes blood vessels to relax) is placed under the patient's tongue. Before and 3 minutes after the nitroglycerin is given, the size of the artery and blood flow through it are measured again.    Blood samples: Blood samples are collected at the beginning and end of the study and at study visits in between.    Study visits: Patients come to the Clinical Center biweekly or monthly for a follow-up history, physical examination, and blood tests. At the end of the3-month treatment period, they receive recommendations about possible treatment modifications to best maintain glucose tolerance. Their physicians are informed of how their blood sugar was controlled. Six months after completing the study, patients undergo a final study evaluation and blood tests, and are then invited to return for yearly checkups after that.

ROS	Completed	Rosiglitazone in the Treatment of HIV-Associated Hyperlipidemia	HIV Infections;   Hyperlipidemia	Drug: Rosiglitazone	                Phase 2              	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00006493?term=ROS&rank=177	NCT00006493	The purpose of this research is to study the effects of rosiglitazone, a drug usually taken for Type II diabetes, on HIV-associated hyperlipidemia. HIV-associated lipodystrophy is a medical condition characterized by gradual changes in the distribution of body fat. The body fat located in the extremities and face disappears while body fat around the abdomen and upper back increases. Certain biochemical changes occur in association with these changes in fat distribution. Lipid levels particularly serum triglycerides are increased. HDL, the "good cholesterol" is decreased. Higher than normal level of insulin or insulin resistance is also found in this condition. This latter condition is one of the hallmarks of Type II diabetes. The protease inhibitors, a class of HIV medications, are associated with the occurrence of HIV-associated lipodystrophy. It has been suggested that a biochemical pathway known as the peripheral peroxisomal activating receptor (PPAR) gamma system is blocked leading to the onset of this condition.  Rosiglitazone is a new drug approved by the FDA in 1999 for the treatment of type II diabetes. It lowers blood sugar by improving insulin resistance, which as mentioned before, is the hallmark of Type II diabetes. It has also been noted to improve blood lipid levels. Rosiglitazone works by stimulating the PPAR gamma system. It is hoped that this drug can turn on the PPAR system and reverse the HIV-associated lipodystrophy syndrome.

Most deaths in these patients arise from the development of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) such as myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or sudden death. ACS is characterized by coronary plaque erosion or rupture, which is triggered by endothelial changes, including inflammation, and thrombosis. Diabetes, with insulin resistance as a major component, has been shown to engender adverse metabolic events within the endothelial cell [1], including impaired endothelial function, augmented vasoconstriction, increased inflammation and thrombosis. Activation of the transcription factors nuclear factor KB (NF-KB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) induces inflammatory gene expression, with liberation of leukocyte-attracting chemokines, increased production of inflammatory cytokines, and augmented expression of cellular adhesion molecules. These metabolic processes may therefore play a significant role in the development of ACS.The hypothesis is that rosiglitazone and metformin, or the combination of both may provide positive anti-atherogenic effect, even among patients without diabetes. This pilot study proposes to evaluate the effect of placebo vs. combined rosiglitazone/metformin (Avandamet ) on surrogate blood markers of atherosclerosis activity among non-diabetic and pre-diabetic patients with known stable coronary syndromes. This will provide further evidence justifying a large definitive outcomes-based clinical trial.

Almost everyone with COPD suffers from shortness of breath (dyspnea) that worsens over time despite standard treatment (inhalers, exercise programs and oxygen). Patients and families have identified relief from dyspnea as a top priority for improved care. New approaches are needed for treating advanced COPD to lessen the burden that it places on the lives of patients and families alike. Opioid drugs, such as morphine, can help in COPD in many ways, including reducing dyspnea, fear and anxiety. Opioids are used widely in cancer for similar symptoms. However, there are historical biases against their use in advanced COPD (mostly due to fear of side effects when much higher doses than the investigators intend have been used in the past). No studies have assessed the value to patients of using low dose opioids in advanced COPD in addition to conventional treatment. The investigators are planning a study that involves recording interviews with about 30 patients and their partner or key family member before and after starting treatment with low dose morphine, to understand their experiences with using morphine. The investigators will also ask them to complete questionnaires about quality of life, dyspnea, anxiety, depression and fear. Descriptions of experiences of using morphine have the potential to inform patients, families, clinicians and professional societies about the benefits and harms of opioid use for dyspnea in the advanced stages of a common serious lung disease when traditional treatments often fail. The investigators will conduct the study in both urban (Halifax and Saskatoon) and in a rural setting (New Brunswick). The investigators' study of an inexpensive and widely available treatment has the potential to improve care and outcomes in advanced COPD for the many Canadians living and dying with this serious lung disease.

Non-diabetics with IR are at risk, but can be difficult to diagnose.  A major problem with the use of IR as a predictor or marker of disease is the lack of a simple, robust test that can be used to quantify this parameter in a wide variety of clinical situations. The current 'gold standard' methods for measuring insulin sensitivity, such as the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic (H-E) clamp, are complex, time consuming and costly. Alternative, simpler methods, such as the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) score, may be less accurate and are not widely accepted.

Because of a lowered sensitivity to the hormone insulin, patients with type II diabetes or glucose-intolerance do not regulate glucose (sugar) effectively. Rosiglitazone is used to treat type II diabetes, but it is not commonly given to patients with heart failure because it can cause leg swelling and, rarely, pulmonary edema. However, patients with heart failure who also have glucose intolerance or type II diabetes generally fare worse than those with heart failure alone, and therapies that decrease insulin resistance may be beneficial to these patients.  Patients 21 years of age and older with heart failure and type II diabetes or glucose intolerance, or both, may be eligible for this study. Patients must be stable on current therapy for heart failure and must not have any planned surgeries for coronary artery disease. Candidates will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for from 2 to 7 days for screening procedures, which include a medical history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram (ECG), chest x-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), exercise testing, and echocardiography (ultrasound test of the heart).  Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either rosiglitazone or placebo (an identical-looking pill with no active ingredient). They will take one tablet a day for the first month, one tablet twice a day for the second month, and then two tablets twice a day from the third month to the end of the study at 6 months. During the treatment period, patients will have a history, physical examination, and blood tests every 4 weeks, exercise testing and echocardiography at 3 and 6 months, and urinalysis, electrocardiogram and MRI at 6 months. To check for fluid accumulation in the legs or lungs, patients will report their weight and symptoms every 2 weeks throughout the study. After the 6-month treatment period, patients will be put back on the diabetes medicines they were taking before the study. Their physicians will be notified of possible modifications in treatment for maintaining optimum glucose tolerance.  Six months after completing treatment (one year after beginning the study), patients will return to the Clinical Center for blood tests to measure the long-term effects of rosiglitazone and to evaluate progress. They will then be invited to return to the clinic for annual checkups, if possible, or for yearly follow-up by mail or telephone to review their health status.

Accordingly, Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma (PPAR¦Ã) agonist (rosiglitazone) would be a great therapeutic option for PCOS as their activation induces transcription factors of gene implicated in fatty acids metabolism.  The aim is to verify if insulin-related hyperandrogenism can be reversed in women having polycystic ovary syndrome following an 8-week treatment with rosiglitazone compared to simple insulin reduction with acarbose.  For the purpose of this study, 14 lean women (BMI ¡Ü 25 kg/m2) and 36 obese women (BMI 30-39 kg/m2) with PCOS as well as 14 lean and 14 obese control women will be recruited to determine their insulin sensibility (insulin levels, M-value, metabolic clearance rate of glucose)and FFA metabolism (FFA levels, rythm of apparition and disapearance of FFA) during a 75g oral glucose tolerance test and a 2-step insulin-glucose clamp.

ROS	Completed	Effects of Rosiglitazone on Blood Vessels in Patients With High Blood Pressure and High Cholesterol	Hypercholesterolemia;   Hypertension			https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00006071?term=ROS&rank=189	NCT00006071	Cells in the lining of blood vessels produce various substances that cause the vessels to dilate (relax) and constrict (tighten), thereby regulating blood flow. In patients with high blood pressure and high cholesterol, the blood vessels do not dilate properly. This study will investigate the effects of rosiglitazone-a drug used to improve the action of insulin in diabetic patients-on blood flow by examining its effects on endothelin (a substance that causes vessel constriction), and other substances produced by the vessel-lining cells.  Adults with blood pressure recordings of 140/90 mmHg or higher on at least three separate days or with a blood cholesterol level of at least 240 mg/dl may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood pressure recordings, blood and urine tests.  This "crossover" study involves two separate treatment periods; that is, participants will take either rosiglitazone or placebo (an inactive look-alike pill) once a day for 8 weeks, then no drug for 4 weeks, and then the alternative treatment for the next 8 weeks. Patients will continue to take their high blood pressure medicines during the first 6 weeks of each treatment period. They will stop the medication 2 weeks before the following procedures, which are done at the end of each 8-week treatment period:  Strain gauge plethysmography-A small catheter is placed through a needle into an artery at the bend of the arm for measuring blood pressure and drawing blood samples during the study. Pressure cuffs are placed on the wrist and upper arm, and a strain gauge (a rubber band device) is placed around the forearm to measure forearm blood flow. When the cuffs are inflated, blood flows into the arm, stretching the strain gauge at a rate proportional to the flow, and the measurement is recorded.  Small doses of four drugs-acetylcholine, bradykinin, sodium nitroprusside and BQ-123-are given through the catheter. Acetylcholine slows the heart rate. Bradykinin stimulates the release of a substance that causes blood vessels to dilate and can lower blood pressure. Sodium nitroprusside causes blood vessels to dilate and is used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. BQ-123 blocks the blood vessel-constricting activity of endothelin.  Brachial ultrasound reactivity study-A baseline ultrasound image (picture produced using sound waves) of the brachial artery (artery located at the bend of the arm) is taken and blood flow measurements are recorded. Then, a pressure cuff is placed around the upper forearm, inflated for 5 minutes to stop blood flow to the forearm, and then released. Images of the artery and flow measurements are repeated. After a 15-minute rest, new baseline images are taken and flow measurements obtained. A small amount of nitroglycerin is then sprayed under the tongue and after 3 minutes, blood flow measurements and brachial artery images are recorded once more.

ROS1 was previously discovered in cell lines where ROS1 fused with other proteins to act as a driver oncogene. In 2007, Rikova et al reported ROS1 fusion as driver mutations in NSCLC cell line (HCC78; SLC34A2-ROS1) and NSCLC patient (CD74-ROS1). Li et al also found about 1% of samples harboring CD74-ROS1 fusion in 202 resected lung adenocarcinomas from never smokers. The incidence was as high as 10% in East Asian population. Currently there are now at least 13 ROS1 fusion variants involving 8 fusion partners (CD74-, SLC34A2-, FIG-, TPM3-, SDC4-, LRIG3-, ERZ-, KDERL2-) identified in ROS1 positive NSCLC. LDK378 is an orally highly selective and potent ALK kinase inhibitor. In preclinical studies, LDK378 has much lower IC50 values than crizotinib in cell lines engineered to express ROS1 rearrangement (0.15 nM versus 3 nM) and is approximately 20-fold more potent. LDK378 is a potent inhibitor of tumor growth in rodent models of both ALCL and NSCLC. We suggest a phase II trial of LDK378 in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with ROS1 rearrangement. The aim of current trial is to evaluate the antitumor efficacy and safety profile of LDK378 and to identify biomarker to predict the tumor response to LDK378.

Lung cancer is associated with a very poor prognosis (<10% patient survival at 5 years). New strategies are urgently needed to improve survival in this group of patients.  The most effective and common treatment for lung cancer is radiotherapy (either alone or combined with chemotherapy and/or surgery) and generally high doses of radiotherapy are given to the tumour. However, increasing the radiotherapy dose carries an increased risk of damage to the surrounding healthy tissue. Damage can be minimised by reducing movement within the lung, caused by factors such as breathing and patient motion, during treatment.  This study tests a new medical device that has been developed to monitor and help patients control their breathing and movement during treatment. Optical sensors will detect any motion of the patient's torso and this will be fed back to the patient in the form of a visual aid allowing them to regulate their breathing and maintain their ideal treatment position.  The device has already been shown to reduce motion in healthy volunteers. In this study the investigators hope to demonstrate that the visual aids are tolerable in lung cancer patients. The investigators additionally aim to show the device will help reduce movements of the chest and also the lung tumour, leading to improvements in treatment results.

RSG XR, the investigational drug used in this study, is an extended-release form of RSG.  This study tests whether RSG XR safely provides clinical benefit to people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) when combined with one of the currently approved AD medications, Aricept , Razadyne  or Exelon . RSG XR is a new approach to AD therapy and this study tests a new way to treat AD by testing whether one's genetic makeup affects the response to the study drug. Clinical data suggesting that RSG may benefit AD patients was first seen in a small study performed at the University of Washington and then from a larger GSK study conducted in Europe and New Zealand. In the first study, subjects receiving RSG once daily for 6 months scored significantly better on 3 tests of memory and thought than those who did not receive RSG. In the GSK study, those that appeared to benefit most from treatment with RSG XR had a specific genetic pattern. They did not have the gene that caused them to produce the protein apolipoprotein E e4 (APOE e4). Subjects who have the APOE e4 gene may have two copies, one from each parent, or they may have only one APOE e4 gene meaning that they inherited either the APOE e2 or APOE e3 version of the gene, instead of APOE e4, from one of their parents. Subjects with one copy of the APOE e4 gene remained at their same level of thinking ability while those with two copies of the APOE e4 gene, continued to worsen during the 6-month treatment. The current study will more directly test the effectiveness or RSG XR on people who either have or lack the APOE e4 gene.

ROS	Terminated	X-Ray Computed Tomography and Blood Reactive Oxygen Species Level	Healthy			https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00712998?term=ROS&rank=161	NCT00712998	The clinically widely used X-ray computed tomography examination has a low-grade radiation effect and recently has attracted much attention concerning the possible adverse effects of radiation on human body [ref. 1-5]. The radiation is harmful to human tissues and cells mainly because it can interact with water (which makes up to 80% of cells) to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially the formation of hydroxyl radicals. So far as we can reach, there is no report concerning the relation between X-ray computed tomography examination and the blood ROS concentration. Therefore, we wish to conduct this study to clarify if the routinely applied X-ray computed tomography examination may induce a higher concentration of ROS in the peripheral blood.  Study subjects will be participants of health check program at our hospital. The only enrollment condition will be a scheduled X-ray computed tomography examination for either lung (20 cases) or heart (20 cases) of the study subject. Another 20 participants receiving health check program without X-ray computed tomography examination will be included as the control group. The formal consent will be delivered to the participants of health check program several days before their admission for health check and will be retrieved before the proceeding of health check.  Measurements and comparison of ROS concentration will be performed in the sampled peripheral blood before and after the performance of X-ray computed tomography examination during a regular health check program. Totally 120 blood samples will be collected from included 60 study subjects within 3 months. Reactive oxygen species£¨ROS£©levels will be measured by a chemiluminescence (CL) analysing system (CLD-110, Tohoku Electronic Industrial, Sendai, Japan).

Studies have shown that certain anti-HIV medications can cause a number of side effects, including high blood sugar (resulting from the body's failure to use insulin), high insulin, and excess fat build-up in the abdominal area. These side effects are known to increase the risk of heart disease. Metformin and rosiglitazone are 2 drugs that have been shown to lower insulin resistance and lessen abdominal fat in patients who are not HIV-infected. This study will investigate the use of these drugs in HIV-infected patients.

The disruption of atherosclerotic plaques and the subsequent formation of thrombi are currently recognized as the major cause of morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, early detection of vulnerable plaques is clinically important for risk stratification and also to provide early treatment. Several imaging approaches have been adapted to detect vulnerable plaques, however, most of them are based on morphologic characteristics of atheroma. We hypothesize that PPAR¦Ã-induced plaque regression could be monitored clinically by use of 18FDG PET/CT approach, which could assess the inflammatory activity, and can be detected noninvasively earlier than previously reported.

But it has not yet been demonstrated that they could protect from a deterioration in insulin secretion in the long term. So, it appears interesting to study the long term evolution of the b-cell function and the possible protection with rosiglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes showing evidence of loss of b-cell function with metformin alone.

ROS	Terminated	Rosiglitazone-Induced Weight Gain	Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2	Drug: Rosiglitazone;   Behavioral: dietary recommendation for weight maintenance		https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00225225?term=ROS&rank=122	NCT00225225	Given the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes and the 2- to 4-fold increased risk of fatal and non-fatal coronary heart disease events in these patients, long-term glycemic control is of great importance. TZDs improves glycemic control in patients with type 2 DM as well as enhances their insulin-mediated glucose disposal. However, the improvement of glycemic control seen with TZDs may be blunted in the long run by weight gain.  Previous data on weight gain during TZD therapy in patients with type 2 DM is very sparse. It is generally assumed that an increase in adipocyte differentiation is the cause of weight gain in association with TZD treatment which may limit their use. Increased body weight assumed to compromise the positive effects of treatment. There is also a theoretical concern that, with the development of new adipocytes, future weight loss may be difficult.  However, if weight gain is primarily due to failure to adjust caloric intake in proportion to the decrease in urinary glucose loss, it is totally preventable. It has been previously shown that improvement of glycemia favored weight gain by decreasing the energy loss in the urine as glucose. Severity of weight gain appears to be proportional to the level of glycemic control achieved.  The overall goal of the proposed research is to provide the experimental evidence for the later alternative by showing that the modest weight gain that takes place in association with effective rosiglitazone treatment of hyperglycemic patients with type 2 DM is primarily due to its therapeutic efficacy. More specifically, by decreasing the caloric intake in proportion to a decrease in urinary glucose loss associated with improved glycemic control, we will be able to prevent significant weight gain following Rosiglitazone treatment. In order to provide an optimal dietary modification that can be universally applied to TZD-treated patients in clinical practice, we will have a group with a fixed amount of caloric restriction per day. It will be the first randomized controlled trial of a potential strategy for prevention of weight gain associated with thiazolidinediones.

ROS	Completed	Individual Sensitivity for Interstitial Lung Diseases	Interstitial Lung Diseases		Maastricht University Medical Center	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00741572?term=ROS&rank=240	NCT00741572	Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) is a collective noun for various chronic lung diseases, including sarcoidosis and idiopathic lung fibrosis (IPF). Sarcoidosis is a multi-systemic disease that includes damage to the lungs in 90% of the patients. Generally, the disease can be described as a systemic, granulomatous and antigen-driven disorder. IPF is a disease of only the lungs, in which an unknown cause induces a strong inflammation reaction leading to acute lung damage that ultimately results in the formation of scar tissue and stiffness of the lungs.  Unfortunately, the exact cause of ILD is still unknown. It is suggested that environmental and work-related exposure to various triggers can exert an effect on the course of the diseases. Examples of such triggers include bacteria, organic agents such as pollen and cotton dust and inorganic agents like metals and talc. Due to this unknown cause, it is difficult to treat ILD. Consequently, the current guideline is no medication or anti-inflammatory agents in severe cases. Unfortunately, this therapy is not completely effective.  Triggers that are suggested to cause ILD can exert their effects via various mechanisms. On the one hand, they can induce an inflammatory reaction as we recently demonstrated for various triggers including instillation material and sicila. During such an inflammatory reaction, cytokines are released that can induce oxidative stress, i.e. an imbalance between the formation of and the protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS). On the other hand, ILD-inducing triggers may directly cause an increased ROS production that subsequently can evoke an inflammatory reaction.  The objective of the current study is to investigate the individual sensitivity for the development of ILD after exposure to various triggers. Main focus will be the differences in the formation of and the protection against ROS as well as the occurring inflammatory reaction after exposure to such triggers.  Furthermore, a simple blood test will be developed to study and eventually even predict the individual reaction of subjects to various triggers.  Finally, to fully characterize the development of ILD after exposure to various triggers, the exhaled air of patients will be studied in order to identify specific markers of oxidative stress and damage.

Risk markers and underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated, and may differ from those in non-diabetic individuals. The unifying theme for the Program Project is that hyperglycemia and insulin resistance alter a number of biological processes which interact in vicious cycles to accelerate atherogenesis and are consequently major underlying risk factors for vascular disease. The overall objectives are to define these unique processes and to elucidate underlying biochemical, metabolic, and genetic determinants of vascular disease complications in diabetes.  RESEARCH PLAN: Over the past 4 years, we have collaborated with the DCCT/EDIC Study Group, and have made novel observations regarding vascular disease pathogenesis in Type 1 Diabetes. This work has focused our studies on specific pathogenic processes. We will now study a Type 2 Diabetes cohort from the VA Cooperative Study, "Glycemic Control and the Complications of Diabetes, Type 2", with high vascular disease event rates. These collaborations provide a unique opportunity to address the pathogenesis of accelerated atherogenesis in the two main types of diabetes, and will greatly augment the scientific knowledge that will be gained in the conduct of these world-class prospective trials.  METHODS: The Program Project has 4 projects and 3 cores. Project 1 will assess lipoproteins, glycoxidative stress, and inflammation as risk factors in studies involving Type 2 Diabetes patients and cultured cell systems. Based on preliminary data from our initial studies Type 1 patients, changes in the NMR lipoprotein subclass profile will be emphasized.  Project 2 will elucidate interactions between inflammation, modifications of lipoproteins, and autoimmunity in vascular disease risk. These novel concepts are also based upon exciting preliminary data pertaining to LDL-antibody complexes.  Project 3 will pursue interesting preliminary data and define the role of the kallikrein-kinin system in vascular disease complications, with effects on mitogenesis and matrix production.  Project 4 will assess the role of the Insulin Resistance Syndrome and novel factors secreted from adipocytes in the pathophysiology of biochemical risk factors and cardiovascular complications.  Cores include an Administrative Core, a Biostatistics and Epidemiology Core which will link with the trials data coordinating centers, and Molecular and Statistical Genetics Core. Investigators will work in close collaboration with the VA Executive Committee, Study Centers, the Hines Coordinating Center, and some of the other ancillary studies. All data analysis involving clinical outcomes will be performed at the Hines Coordinating Center.  There is true synergism among the projects at both scientific and logistical levels. The Program Project design allows for interactions among multidisciplinary investigators studying the same cohort, which will define how multiple pathological processes interact at the level of the arterial wall to promote atherosclerosis.

Recent evidence suggests that increased levels of free fatty acids (FFA) in obese subjects is a leading candidate in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance (1-4). In our preliminary studies on the effect of FFA on insulin secretion and action (lipotoxicity), we have observed that the infusion of Intralipid/heparin to increase FFA ~ four-fold-baseline levels for 48 hours results in a significant and reproducible raise in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) in obese African American subjects with and without diabetes. The increase in blood pressure is apparent after 12 hours of infusion, reaching a peak increment of 32 mm Hg in systolic and 14 mm Hg in diastolic pressure at 24 hours. These preliminary findings indicate that, in addition to the well-known effect on insulin resistance, sustained elevation of FFA results in the development of an acute metabolic syndrome.

ROS	Completed	Underlying Abnormalities in Fat and Muscle Leading to Lipodystrophy Syndrome	HIV Infections;   Lipodystrophy;   Insulin Resistance	Drug: Avandia administration for 6-12 weeks	                Phase 1              	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00006185?term=ROS&rank=260	NCT00006185	With the advent of highly active anti-retroviral therapy(HAART), patients with HIV disease are developing a series of metabolic abnormalities including peripheral fat wasting, increase in truncal fat, high serum triglyceride levels, insulin(a hormone that controls blood sugar) resistance with an increased incidence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and elevated blood pressure. The premise of this study is that abnormalities in the ability of fat and muscle tissue to respond to the hormone insulin may be the cause of the diabetes mellitus, high serum triglyceride levels and abnormal fat distribution. The purpose of the study is to assess how insulin resistant patients with HIV disease are and if their fat and muscle tissue are responding abnormally to insulin. This is done by administering insulin and taking small tissue samples of fat and muscle from the upper thigh and assessing how good insulin acts in these tissues.  Patients with HIV disease will be admitted into the study after undergoing a screening medical history and examination. Once patients qualify, they will have their insulin resistance measured as well as the response of their fat and muscle to insulin; blood levels of glucose (sugar), cholesterol and triglycerides will be measured; body fat will be assessed using radiological tests; a detailed medical history will be obtained to assess risk factors for developing this syndrome.  Patients who are found to be insulin resistant will be offered a trial of an insulin sensitizing agent, called Avandia, for 6-12 weeks. It is hoped that the Avandia will restore the body's ability to respond normally to insulin (as it does in patients with Diabetes) and perhaps improve the fat abnormalities as well. All the same measures will be performed at the end of the course of Avandia as were done at baseline.  Patients who are not insulin resistant will be asked to come back yearly to assess whether they develop insulin resistance over time. This study will continue to recruit patients over the next 3 years.

Behavioral: Control group;   Behavioral: Lifestyle counselling		https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02027077?term=ROS&rank=252	NCT02027077	Obesity is a major risk factor for disease and a public health problem. Recent information suggests that while it is possible for most overweight adults to lose a substantial amount of weight, maintaining the weight loss for any extended time (2 to 3 years) is very difficult. This is because trying to maintain big changes in exercise and/or eating behaviour is very difficult in today's environment that makes sustain big changes in behaviour (Example: eat allot less or exercise allot more) very hard. In fact at this time health professionals are unsure of how best to help overweight adults maintain big behavioral changes for long periods of time. In response, we propose that making smaller changes in eating and exercise habits every day may be possible in today's environment and if so, small weight changes may be possible to maintain for long periods of time. This study is designed to assess whether making small changes in eating and exercise behavior will be associated with sustained weight loss over three (3) years. The results of the study may have important implications for development of public health messages and clinical guidelines for prevention and treatment of obesity through small changes in both exercise and eating habits.

The study hypothesis is that intervention families will have lower (better) acute stress disorder scores when their child is discharged from the PICU and lower (better) post-traumatic stress disorder scores at 3-month follow-up, as compared to the control group families. The investigators will recruit 220 families (110 in each of the control and intervention groups). Families who are randomized to the intervention group will receive routine visits from members of the PACT (palliative care) team at least three times/week to address psychosocial needs, keep families informed about their child's health status, and offer emotional and instrumental support and resources. Families in the control group will receive usual care in the PICU. The intervention will end whenever the child is discharged from the PICU, which usually happens within 3 weeks of enrollment. The investigators will assess family outcomes at discharge from the PICU and 90 days after study enrollment. The investigators will conduct two additional activities to learn more about the processes of care for those in both the intervention and control groups. First, during the intervention, the investigators will recruit 30 families (15 in each group) and ask permission to audio-record the family care conferences to assess communication styles and gain greater insight into the differences in practice with or without the participation of the intervention team. The investigators will obtain additional consent from participants in these family conferences who are not otherwise enrolled in the study. Second, after completion of the 3-month follow-up interview, a sub-sample of a different 30 families (again, 15 in each group) will be invited to participate in qualitative interviews to debrief about their experience in the study and the intervention (for those in that group). This will be a one-time interview scheduled within 60 days of recruitment for this part of the project.

Despite aggressive rehabilitation, lasting upper extremity impairment remains in the majority of stroke survivors. It is hypothesized that enhancing neuroplasticity through the combination of drug therapy and physical therapy could enhance outcomes for stroke survivors. The combination of levodopa and intensive physical therapy shows promise in enhancing the functional motor recovery of stroke patients during the sub-acute and chronic period without reported significant side effects. Robotic-aided training is a promising tool that has the potential to deliver high-intensity, task-oriented, reproducible therapy that can decrease the burden on a therapist. Since the evidence behind dopaminergic potentiation of neuroplasticity and stroke recovery is promising, it is the investigators aim to combine dopaminergic drug therapy with highly intensive robotic-assisted therapy to provide superior upper extremity functional recovery over traditional stroke rehabilitation.

This means that all doctors would use the same approach to diagnose appendicitis in children in the emergency department. This pathway uses two scoring systems to identify patients who are at high and low risks of appendicitis. These scoring systems are based on the patient's symptoms, signs the doctor finds when examining the patient, and their blood tests. The goal of this part of the study is to determine if the investigators' pathway accurately identifies patients who have appendicitis.

First, the investigators want to search out the effects of the past history, smoking, alcohol drinking, use of antioxidants, different diseases, and different duration of SIRS on the degree of oxidative stress. Second, besides total count of ROS, the investigators used new techniques to determine superoxide(O2¡ñ-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hypochlorous acid(HOCl). Furthermore, we want to investigate the correlation of the degree of different reactive oxygen species and the severity of SIRS or shock. Third, we try to investigate the correlation between the change of oxidative stress and the prognosis of the patients.

Therefore, most treatment protocols have involved immunosuppressive drugs given singly or in combination. However, the efficacy of this type of therapy has been disappointing and the long-term prognosis for renal survival in patients with resistant FSGS is poor. An alternative approach that targets the fibrosis pathway may represent a novel approach to the treatment of resistant FSGS. In this R21, the investigators will test the hypothesis that two novel agents - a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-¦Á) antagonist and a peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-gamma (PPAR¦Ã) agonist - can be administered safely to patients with resistant FSGS. In the R21 feasibility/pilot phase, pharmacokinetic studies will be conducted to assess the impact of proteinuria on the kinetics of the novel drugs in children and adults.  Specific Aim #1: To assess the safety and tolerability of two novel drugs - a TNF-¦Á antagonist and a PPAR¦Ã agonist - in patients with resistant FSGS.

Our recent data showed that inflammation predicts mortality and cardiovascular death, independent of other cardiovascular risk factors in peritoneal dialysis patients. As a considerable proportion of peritoneal dialysis patients showed evidence of inflammation, it raises an important question as to whether anti-inflammatory treatment has any cardiovascular and survival benefit in these patients. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-g) agonist is a class of drug with insulin sensitizing property. Recent experimental and clinical studies demonstrated that this class of drug has anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic properties other than insulin sensitizing effect in type 2 diabetics. We therefore hypothesize that modulation of the PPAR-g activity may be a novel therapeutic strategy for reducing inflammation and retarding the progression of atherosclerosis and possibly lowering mortality in our peritoneal dialysis patients.

Severe complications such as pulmonary infiltration and pulmonary edema following reperfusion were frequently associated with liver transplantation. Cardiac surgery performed with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) provokes a systemic inflammatory response syndrome that affects postoperative pulmonary, myocardiac and renal functions. Previous study about the reperfusion injuries was focused on the leukocyte and endothelial activation and the following oxidative injuries, however, the alteration on pulmonary function such as dynamic compliance and the oxidative/antioxidative balance in erythrocytes and the following effects in CPB have not been fully studied. Erythrocytes' reaction to oxidative stress including cytoplasma and cell membrane should be studied because RBCs are the major circulating blood cells having different types of antioxidant system to capture reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) thus RBC may be severely injured by ROS or protected ROS injuries during CPB. In these three-year study, we plan to explore the extent and pattern of remote oxidative injuries in lungs by massive ROS production and the following products released from reperfused organs. In the first year, the remote pulmonary injuries from hepatic IR will be focused. We plan to establish an animal model for pulmonary function and pulmonary injury assessments including dynamic compliance (Cdyn), pulmonary edema wet-to-dry ratio (W/D), malondialdehyde (MDA) and histopathological findings under hepatic IR challenge. In the second year, the IR effects during and after CPB on circulating blood cells will be fully studied. We plan to investigate the magnitude, subtypes and timing on ROS production, the changes of oxidative and antioxidant activities of erythrocytes including cytoplasma and cell membrane, the changes on leukocytes and plasma to explore the roles of circulating erythrocytes on oxidative stress in CPB. In the third year, we plan to try propofol, stated having antioxidant in vivo and in vitro, on the remote pulmonary injuries following hepatic IR and CPB.

ROS	Unknown  	Calorie Restriction Retards the Aging Process	Obesity	Behavioral: energy restricted mediterranean-type diet;   Behavioral: 25 % calorie restriction	dbunout@inta.uchile.cl	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01508091?term=ROS&rank=242	NCT01508091	Calorie restriction is the only experimental manipulation that prolongs longevity in experimental animals. The life prolonging effects of calorie restriction are related to a lower incidence of tumors and less inflammation, but more importantly, a lower generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This effect is related to the overexpression of two groups of enzymes. One is a group of (NAD+)©\dependent deacetylases called sirtuins whose main actions are to increase free fatty acid flow from adipose tissue, improve insulin secretion and promote mitochondrial biogenesis in muscle. The other group corresponds to uncoupling proteins (UCP), specially UCP 3 that reduces the mitochondrial production of ROS. On the other hand, an effect of calorie restriction that is always reported, is a decrease in resting energy expenditure. A reduction in the activity of UCP1 in brown adipose tissue could be a mechanisms to explain this effect. However sirtuins apparently increase the expression of UCP1.Recently PET CT scans have emerged as a non invasive methodology to recognize brown adipose tissue activity and indirectly, UCP1 activity. Also measurement of telomere length in peripheral blood mononuclear cells has consolidated as a good marker of aging. Two possible models of calorie restriction can be studied in humans. One is a retrospective model in which adults are separated in those that have maintained a stable weight during adulthood in a manner analogous to the weight clamp model of calorie restriction in non human primates. This model is only reliable if there are objective records of the weight that the studied subjects had 20 or more years ago. In the retrospective part of this project the investigators propose to study adults whose weight was recorded previously. The investigators pretend to compare telomere length and expression of SIRT1 and 6 in PBMC, plasma 8 isoprostanes and carotid intima media thickness between weight maintainers and weight gainers. The investigators hypothesis is that weight maintainers will have a better aging profile than weight gainers. In the prospective part of the project the investigators will study a human model of calorie restriction prescribing a 25% reduction in calorie intake during 3 months and comparing groups according to weight loss. At baseline and the end of the study period, UCP3 and SIRT1 expression in muscle biopsies, SIRT1 and 6 expression in PBMC and brown adipose activity, assessed by 18fluorodeoxyglucose uptake using PET/CT will measured. The investigators hypothesis is that individuals subjected to calorie restriction will experience an increase in the expression of UCP3, SIRT1 and SIRT6 and a reduction in brown adipose tissue activity. Simultaneously, these subjects will experience a reduction in oxidative stress markers in muscle and plasma.

Newer research indicates that inflammation is a key contributor to atrial fibrillation in this setting.  Melatonin is a naturally made hormone that is regarded as an extremely effective anti-inflammatory substance, with a very favorable safety profile. This clinical trial is being done to test the ability of melatonin to reduce the risk of developing atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery.  This is a research study where patients will be given either oral melatonin at 40 mg or placebo nightly prior to sleep. The study product will start approximately 2 days prior to the scheduled surgery date and will continue until the 3rd day after the operation.

BPA was been reported in several female reproductive disturbance. However, the pathological pathway of BPA impact on female reproductive system had not been well-understood. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have a role in the modulation of gamete quality and gamete interaction. Persistent and elevated generation of ROS leads to a disturbance of redox potential that in turn causes oxidative stress (OS).

ROS	Unknown  	A Retrospective Study of Biomarkers in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer	Non Small Cell Lung Cancer			https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01100840?term=ROS&rank=288	NCT01100840	The purpose of this study is:      To characterize the types and frequency of molecular alterations to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, FGFR4 and EML-ALK in Asian patients with non-small cell lung cancer    To identify candidate biomarkers of importance in the EGFR and estrogen pathways    Most, if not all, human malignancies including lung cancer are caused by somatic alterations of the genome, leading to activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and their resultant oncogenic effects. In addition to mutations, increased chromosomal copy number (by amplification or polysomy) and DNA methylation are other mechanisms of oncogene activation and tumour suppressor gene inactivation respectively.  Little is known about the relationship between these oncogenes of the EGFR family and the recently described oncogenes FGFR4 and fusion gene EML4-ALK. Recent data suggests molecularly defined subgroups of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) exist and can be used to predict for sensitivity to targeted agents (erlotinib or gefitinib) or cytotoxic chemotherapy (pemetrexate, gemcitabine, platinum agents). The findings that estrogen receptors are present in lung tumours and that estrogen can stimulate growth and proliferation of lung cancers in vitro and in vivo are provocative. Further studies to evaluate the role of estrogens and other sex hormones in lung cancer are warranted.  A further understanding of the molecular indicators of lung cancer prognosis and treatment prediction would improve drug development and patient treatment selection.  Archived paraffin-embedded and fresh frozen NSCLC tumor tissue will be obtained via the Department of Pathology and the National University Tissue Repository respectively. Clinico-pathological characteristics will be obtained from the case records, Pathology and Tissue Repository. DNA will be isolated using standard techniques. Sequencing of genes in the EGFR signaling pathway: EGFR, KRAS, ErbB2, ErbB3, MET, PI3K, and BRAF as well as FGFR4. Unstained slides from the paraffin-embedded tissue will be obtained and subjected to fluoresce in vitro hybridization (FISH) for breakpoints in the EML4 and ALK genes as previously described. For cases that have been snap-frozen, RNA will be extracted and EML4-ALK fusions will be confirmed using RT-PCR and pre-specified primers. To analyse the expression of proteins of putative relevance to EGFR function (such as EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, AKT, MET, STAT, ERK, MAPK, cyclin D1, C/EBPa), downstream effects of EGFR: cell proliferation (Ki-67), angiogenesis (CD34, VEGF-A), apoptosis (bcl-2), metastasis, and hormonal influence (oestrogen and progesterone receptors, aromatase), TMA technology will be utilised. The status of the tumor suppressor genes PTEN and C/EBPa will be analysed.

ROS	Terminated	The Assessment of Oxidative Stress Markers and the Development of Atrial Fibrillation After Cardiac Surgery	Atrial Fibrillation			https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00846534?term=ROS&rank=320	NCT00846534	The purpose of the investigators study is to investigate the correlation between naturally occurring chemicals, called reactive oxygen species (ROS), in the blood of human patients and the development of an abnormal heart rhythm, known as atrial fibrillation (AF). The development of atrial fibrillation is associated with increased medical problems like stroke. Many factors seem to cause the development of AF, and this rhythm occurs frequently after open heart surgery. When patients develop AF after cardiac surgery they are at increased risk for cognitive changes, infections, the development of kidney failure, and increased length of hospitalization. ROS are chemicals in blood and tissues that tend to cause microscopic blood vessel and heart damage. These chemicals occur naturally as the result of chemical reactions that occur in states of stress and inflammation, like tissue trauma and as the result of smoking. Patients who undergo cardiac surgery may have higher levels of ROS because of their underlying medical conditions. In addition, the organized tissue trauma that occurs in the setting of surgery may serve to increase ROS levels further. In turn, the higher ROS levels may put patients at even higher risk for the development of AF. The investigators believe that increased levels of ROS may help potentiate a patient's development of AF. Accordingly the investigators aim to measure ROS levels before and after surgery to see if there are particular levels that predict the development of this abnormal heart rhythm. By developing a better knowledge of the relationship between ROS and AF, the investigators hope to better understand another possible method of detecting patients who are at the highest risk of developing AF before it occurs after surgery. If these patients are better identified, this may eventually lead to medical treatment to prevent AF; and hopefully this will result in a decrease of the malicious effects that result from developing this abnormal heart rhythm.

By comparison to younger adults, obesity reduction in the elderly presents a unique challenge and requires an innovative approach. We propose a novel approach to investigate the effects of different exercise types as independent treatment strategies for the reduction of obesity and related health risk factors in older men and women. We propose that exercise without caloric restriction will be associated with modest weight loss (3-5%), that in turn will be associated with significant reduction in abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, and a corresponding increase in skeletal muscle mass and function. We will determine the separate effects of resistance and aerobic exercise on these primary outcome variables, and, whether a treatment strategy that combines the two is optimal.

ROS	Recruiting	Analyses of Bone Marrow and Blood Samples From Healthy Volunteers: Focus on the redOx Metabolism	redOx Metabolism	Procedure: Blood test;   Procedure: Medullar test	roussel@med.univ-tours.fr	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02789839?term=ROS&rank=318	NCT02789839	Oxidative stress is defined by an excess of reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species or ROS) in cells. ROS are essential to cell life (proliferation, differentiation), including kinase activity via inhibition of phosphatases. Very low levels of ROS are observed in quiescent cells, including hematopoietic stem cells. Conversely, an excess of ROS can induce DNA damage that may lead to the destruction of the cell.  The level of ROS in cells is the result of production (mainly the NADPHoxydase and the mitochondrial respiratory chain) and their disposal via antioxidant enzymes. The hematology team of the university hospital of Tours (France) found that certain antioxidant enzymes are essential for the self-renewal of normal and leukemic cells such as glutathione peroxidase-3 (Herault O et al, J Exp Med 2012, 209:895). Their expression is modified in hematological diseases (patent WO2012085188A1 / 2012-06-28 and FR1000267310 / 2014-11-27).  Age potentially affects the level of expression of antioxidant genes, since it was established a decrease in glutathione peroxidase activity in women over 65 years (Sara E, J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci 2008 63: 505). The study HEALTHOX will determine the impact of age on the oxidative metabolism of normal hematopoietic cells, and in particular the expression of antioxidant genes. It will provide a reference for analyzing disturbances of oxidative metabolism in blood diseases. The main objective is the comparison of peripheral blood and bone marrow cells depending from 3 groups of healthy volunteers: 18-39 years, 40-59 years and 60-85 years. The level of ROS and the expression of genes encoding the major antioxidant enzymes involved in the regulation of oxidative stress will be studied. The secondary objectives are to create a cell bank (blood and marrow), a blood plasma bank and a cDNA library (blood and marrow) from healthy volunteers.

Recent behavioral studies have shown that the neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor is involved in opioid reward and withdrawal. This study proposes to study a potential non-opioid treatment, the clinically available, FDA approved, NK1 antagonist aprepitant, in opioid addicted patients. Based on the unique behavioral and pharmacological characteristics of opioid addiction, and what is known of the currently employed treatments, the investigators propose that the therapeutic mechanism of any potential opioid addiction treatment medication must include the ability to reduce opioid withdrawal. This is of particular importance during treatment initiation (eg. detoxification). In addition, for long-term treatment and relapse prevention, it is important to manage drug craving and inhibit the rewarding effects of opioids if patients do experience a slip. Therefore, the investigators propose to study aprepitant using human models of opioid withdrawal, craving and acute opioid reward and reinforcement. The investigators will also include a neuro-economics choice procedure paradigm.

Periodontal diseases are among the most common diseases in humans, therefore, if the presence of periodontal diseases plays any role in overall systemic health, the public health impact may be substantial. An important factor that can be involved in the progression of the periodontal disease is the production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). The imbalance between oxidative stress induced by ROS and the concentrations (or activity) of the antioxidant may result in tissue damage. The ROS induce the activity of lipid peroxidation-Tbars, myeloperoxidase (MPO), peroxidase and arginase, whose mechanisms reflect the severity of the periodontal disease and it may offer the basis for a patient specific diagnostic test for periodontitis and could have therapeutic significance. The aim of this study is to investigate quantitatively the levels of oxidative stress markers (Myeloperoxidase, Peroxidase, Lipid Peroxidation and Arginase) in saliva and in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) of diabetes type 2 subjects with generalized chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy individuals, and systematically healthy individuals with generalized chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy individuals, before and after periodontal treatment. Unstimulated whole saliva will be collected for 5 min as well as GCF of 25 diabetes type 2 with generalized chronic periodontitis, 25 diabetes type 2 periodontally healthy individuals as controls, 25 systematically healthy individuals with generalized chronic periodontitis and 25 periodontally healthy individuals before and after treatment. The following clinical parameters will be evaluated: probing pocket depth, probing attachment level, plaque index and the gingival index.

ROS	Completed	The Effect of an Orange Peel Extract on Exercise Performance	Exercise Recovery and Endurance	Dietary Supplement: Citrus flavonoid;   Dietary Supplement: Placebo		https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02787733?term=ROS&rank=338	NCT02787733	Rationale: Numerous studies have shown the positive effect of a healthy diet and regular moderate exercise. Although, exercise has also been correlated with an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and a higher incidence of injury. ROS production seems to induce muscle damage, which reduces muscle performance and induces fatigue. Increasing muscle recovery could be an effective way to increase exercise performance. Several food ingredients have been of growing interest due to their specific functioning on the human body. Citrus flavonoids are abundantly available in citrus fruits. Prior studies show a positive effect of citrus flavonoids on endothelial function, by promoting vasodilation. In addition it has a positive effect on the nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, a known compound in regulating endothelial response. This capacity of citrus flavonoids could be useful in stimulating performance and recovery after exercise. Additionally, the ability of scavenging ROS could reduce muscle damage caused by exercise induced oxidative damage.  Objective: Determine the 4-week effect of daily citrus flavonoid supplementation on exercise recovery and performance.  Study design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with parallel design, in which 40 subjects engage in three exercise sessions. The sessions will be subdivided into a pre-test and test 1 and 2. Between test 1 and 2, participants receive daily for 4 weeks citrus flavonoid supplement or a placebo. Each day, subjects should consume 2 capsules each morning, containing in total 500 mg of citrus flavonoids or 500 mg placebo.  Study population: The subjects will be healthy normal weight trained males, with an age of 18 - 25. Additionally, subjects are non-smokers and free of a medication.  Intervention: Participants will be randomly placed in either the citrus flavonoid or placebo group. Participants will be instructed to ingest 2 capsules each morning for 4 consecutive weeks. Each capsule equals to 250 mg of citrus flavonoids or cellulose in case of the placebo treatment.  Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameter is the average amount of work load produced during the 10-minute time trail test. In addition, oxygen per minute will be determined as well as the heart rate. Finally, for each test, the subjective rating of perceived exertion (RPE) will be determined during the pre-test and test 1 and 2 by using a Borg scale.

However, this therapy may not be sustainable because of the toxicities of the medications. Evidence suggests that HIV-infected patients on HAART may be at risk for premature coronary artery disease. The exact cause is unknown. It is possible that the medications directly affect the endothelium (the lining of the arteries that supply blood to the heart) and lead to premature heart disease. Or because the medications cause lipid abnormalities (high cholesterol) and a condition of relative insulin resistance, in which the body has a difficult time processing sugars; known risk factors for endothelial dysfunction and heart disease. Therapeutic intervention that reverses these lipid abnormalities and/or insulin resistance may lower these risk factors, normalize endothelial function, and decrease the risk of heart disease.  This protocol aims to assess endothelial function among a group of HIV-infected patients with varying degrees of viral activity and levels of immune function on a variety of HAART regimens. It also aims to evaluate the effect of three different medications on lipids, insulin resistance, and thus endothelial function. Understanding the factors involved in causing endothelial dysfunction will help better characterize the relative risks and benefits of early versus late and continuous versus intermittent HAART therapy. The research may offer some insights into the causes of premature heart disease among HIV-infected patients on HAART that could be more thoroughly investigated in subsequent clinical trials.  A total of 75 patients will be recruited: 25 for each arm of the study. Each arm evaluates the potential benefit of a particular medication and will enroll sequentially. An endothelial function test will be performed on an outpatient basis. The first 25 patients will be assigned at random to receive pravastatin sodium or placebo; the next 25 will receive gemfibrozil or placebo; the final 25 will receive rosiglitazone or placebo. Patients will take the pills for 6 weeks, no pills for the next 4 weeks, and then the opposite treatment for 6 more weeks. Two weeks after the start of the study drug, blood will be taken to check for potential toxic side effects. After each 6-week treatment, blood will be drawn and endothelial function tests will be performed.

Low dietary intake or low blood levels of lutein and zeaxanthin, which are the only pigments found in the macular region of the human retina, has been associated with an increased risk for AMD. We have reported that the dietary supplementation of lutein and zeaxanthin can increase the macular pigments (MP) of the eye. MP effectively absorbs blue light as well as quenches reactive oxygen species (ROS). Green tea polyphenols are also effective scavenger of ROS in vitro.  Our goal is to elucidate how to effectively increase MP by physiologic levels of antioxidant supplementation. We hypothesize that lutein and tea polyphenols protect the macula of the eye by increasing MP carotenoids effectively through an antioxidant mechanism.

This evolution is associated with accumulation of cytogenetic mutations which leads to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Evolution of MDS is also associated with increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The increase of ROS is associated with accumulation of cytogenetic mutations. Ascorbic acid (AA) is an actor of the regulation of the oxidative metabolism in the human body.  Studies showed that supplementation with AA can change the proliferation status of MDS cells. Adjuvant treatment with AA is associated with a beneficial effect on the evolution of MDS and AML.

ROS	Completed	The Impact of Zinc Supplementation on Left Ventricular Function in Nonischemic Cardiomyopathy	Heart Failure;   Cardiomyopathies	Drug: Zinc Acetate	                Phase 1              University of Michigan	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00696410?term=ROS&rank=358	NCT00696410	Heart failure affects over 5.3 million Americans and, while other cardiovascular diseases have enjoyed a reduction in mortality rates over the last decade, the mortality from heart failure continues to rise[1]. Thus, identifying novel therapies that can reduce heart failure development and/or progression are warranted. Unifying to most cardiomyopathic processes is an impaired handling of reactive oxygen species (ROS)[2-4]. Reactive oxygen species are generated as byproducts of inflammation and oxidative stress that occur in the setting of normal myocardial aerobic metabolism. Metallothionein, glutathione reductase, and superoxide dismutase are major antioxidants in the myocardium that help combat oxidative stress and prevent myocardial damage. In certain clinical settings, including cardiac ischemia, diabetes, and heavy metal excess (copper, iron), myocardial oxidative stress levels are greatly increased. When pro-oxidant levels exceed myocardial antioxidant capabilities, ROS-induced membrane, protein, and DNA inactivation can lead to the development of cardiac dysfunction.  One means of preventing the development or progression of cardiomyopathy is to reduce oxidative stress through up-regulation of intramyocardial antioxidants. Murine studies of cardiomyopathy have shown that oral administration of zinc acetate may succeed as an indirect myocardial anti-oxidant because zinc sufficiently up-regulates the intramyocardial production of superoxide dismutase (a zinc-dependant anti-oxidant enzyme) and metallothionein (a "super antioxidant") [5-8]. Zinc also directly reduces prooxidant Cu levels by reducing gastrointestinal zinc absorption. However, to date, no studies have examined the impact of zinc acetate supplementation in subjects with cardiomyopathy and systolic failure on antioxidant capacity and remodeling.  The hypothesis of this pilot study is that administration of oral zinc acetate to humans with cardiomyopathy will lead to an up-regulation of myocardial anti-oxidant capabilities,leading to a favorable reduction in oxidative stress. This study will provide preliminary data to support a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of zinc therapy in heart failure as a means of improving or preventing the progression of systolic dysfunction in subjects with mild-moderate heart failure.

ROS	Completed	A Community Based Approach to Dyslipidemia Management: Pharmacist Prescribing to Achieve Cholesterol Targets	Dyslipidemias	Other: Pharmacist care		https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01581372?term=ROS&rank=357	NCT01581372	Background:  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the cause of one-third of all deaths in Canada. One important risk factor for CVD is dyslipidemia. The Canadian Health Measures survey, which was conducted from 2007-2009, found that roughly 36% of Canadians had unhealthy levels of LDL. Despite strong evidence and clear practice guidelines for the management of this risk factor, it remains poorly treated.  Pharmacists are front-line primary care professionals who see patients at risk for cardiovascular disease more frequently than other healthcare professionals. As such, pharmacists have the opportunity to systematically and proactively identify patients with undertreated dyslipidemia, as one public health approach to chronic disease management.  The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of enhanced pharmacist care (i.e., participant identification, assessment, care plan development, education/counseling, prescribing/titration of lipid-lowering medications and close follow-up) on the proportion of participants achieving target LDL-cholesterol levels.  Hypothesis: Enhanced pharmacist care will result in a more significant decrease in LDL-c levels, than that observed in the usual care patients.  Design:  This is a randomized controlled trial of enhanced pharmacist care. The study will be conducted in twelve community pharmacies in Alberta, including several Safeway Pharmacies. The participant population will be composed of adults with uncontrolled dyslipidemia as defined by the 2009 Canadian Dyslipidemia Guidelines. The primary intervention will be pharmacist directed dyslipidemia care. Participants randomized to usual care will receive usual care from their pharmacist and physician.  Study Implications:  To the investigators knowledge, this study is the first randomized trial of pharmacist prescribing in dyslipidemia. This study will have important implications for improving patients' access to care, especially as most provinces are proceeding with granting additional prescribing authority to pharmacists. The ability to conduct this study in a province where pharmacists already have the ability to prescribe is unique. The results will also encourage more pharmacists to get involved in cardiovascular prevention and will increase the number of prescribers in the area of dyslipidemia.

The genotype 3R/3R is more common in East Asia and is associated with greater tolerability to fluoropyrimidine as measured by lower toxicity but also lower response rates. As sensitivity to fluoropyrimidine appears to be affected by TYMS genotype, we hypothesise that patients with TYMS 3R/3R are more tolerant to standard doses of capecitabine and require higher doses to overcome fluoropyrimidine resistance. We designed this study to develop TYMS genotype specific dosing of capecitabine.  Aims:      To determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of capecitabine twice a day for two weeks followed by one week rest period (intermittent schedule) in patients with the advanced/ and or metastatic cancer based on TYMS genotype.    To determine a suitable phase II dose of intermittent schedule capecitabine.    To determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen.    To perform plasma pharmacokinetics of capecitabine.

ROS	Recruiting	Molecular Basis of Human Phagocyte Interactions With Bacterial Pathogens	Normal Neutrophil Function			https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00339287?term=ROS&rank=356	NCT00339287	Human phagocytic cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) are readily mobilized to sites of infection and ingest microorganisms by a process known as phagocytosis. The combined effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proteolytic peptides and enzymes released into forming bacterial phagosomes kill most ingested bacteria. However, many human bacterial pathogens have devised means to subvert normal phagocyte responses and the innate immune response and cause severe disease.  The overall objective of this study is to elucidate specific features of pathogen-phagocyte interactions that underlie evasion of the innate immune response or contribute to the pathophysiology of disease or inflammatory disorders. Therefore, specific projects will:      Identify and characterize specific mechanisms used by pathogenic microorganisms to evade or subvert normal phagocyte responses and therefore cause disease.    Investigate phagocyte response mechanisms to specific pathogenic microorganisms.    Identify specific bacterial structures and/or (gene) products that dictate differences in phagocyte responses among a range of pathogens so that generalized statements can be made about the pathophysiology of disease states.    The studies will be performed using multiple techniques including state-of-the-art equipment for genomics and proteomics strategies to identify target bacterial genes/proteins of interest or those up-regulated in phagocytes. Phagocyte-pathogen interactions will be examined using fluorescence-based real-time assays and video microscopy, confocal and electron microscopy in combination with enzymatic assays for ROS production, routine biochemistry, immunology and cell biology.  Implementing these studies will require isolation of phagocytic leukocytes from venous blood of healthy human volunteers. The study population will be all-inclusive except in certain instances where individuals possess genetic defects that impair phagocyte function (e.g., myeloperoxidase-deficiency) or have altered phagocyte function due to outside influences such as recent bacterial or viral infection.  The proposed studies will likely provide new information pertinent to understanding host cell-pathogen interactions and the pathophysiology of inflammatory conditions.

ROS	Not yet recruiting	A Study Comparing a Shorter Exposure of Oocyte to Spermatozoa Versus a Standard Incubation on the Live Birth Rate of In-vitro Fertilization Treatment	Fertility;   In Vitro Fertilization	Procedure: a shorter exposure of oocyte to spermatozoa	coco831011@51mch.com	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02534857?term=ROS&rank=355	NCT02534857	In vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment is now commonly used to treat infertile couples. During IVF treatment, oocytes and sperm are routinely incubated overnight and this may lead to suboptimal culture conditions because of increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by sperm in the standard incubation. High levels of ROS can adversely affect the quality of the embryos, result in hardening of the zona pellucida and impair the implantation capacity of embryos. Studies shows successful fertilization of an oocyte occurs 20mins after the gametes are put together. Sperm can penetrate through the cumulus cells within 15min, and 80% of oocytes can be fertilized when they are exposed to a large number of spermatozoa within 1hr. As an attempt to avoid possible detrimental effects on the oocytes from long exposure to sperm, the brief incubation insemination protocol was developed. It implies that prolonged incubation of oocytes and sperm may not be necessary and may even be harmful. Some reports suggest that a sperm-oocyte exposure time of 1-6 h improves IVF outcomes. However, other studies report no such advantage with a short insemination time .  A recent meta-analysis shows brief incubation of gametes was associated with significantly higher rates of clinical pregnancy , ongoing pregnancy and higher rate of implantation than standard incubation. But the rates of normal fertilization, good quality embryos and polyspermy were not significantly different compared with standard incubation. In a Cochrane meta-analysis, eight RCTs with 733 women were included, and showed similar results. But it only reported clinical pregnancy rate and ongoing pregnancy rate which were significantly higher in brief incubation group than standard incubation. However, the live birth rate, which is the important outcome parameter, was not reported in all these studies. It is uncertain whether brief incubation improves the life birth rate compared with standard incubation.  The aim of this randomized double blinded study is to compare the live birth rate of IVF treatment following brief incubation of oocytes and sperm versus standard incubation. The hypothesis is that a brief incubation improves the live birth rate of IVF treatment.

Uric acid (UA), the end product of purine metabolism, emerged as an important determinant of renal and vascular injury due to its ability activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and increase production of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS cause progressive endothelial cell dysfunction, inflammation, tissue fibrosis and eventually cell death. These processes are enhanced in DM because of the effect of hyperglycemia.  Since existing preventive drug therapies fail to completely prevent kidney damage, an examination of the effect of UA lowering against initiation and progression of renal and vascular complications is therefore of the utmost importance. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of UA lowering with febuxostat on renal and systemic vascular function in patients with uncomplicated T1DM. It was hypothesized that UA lowering will improve kidney and systemic vascular function through effects on blood vessel function and anti-inflammatory effect.  Kidney and blood vessel function will be assessed under conditions of normal and high blood sugar levels before and after 8 weeks of treatment with the UA lowering drug febuxostat in patients with diabetes and during normoglycemia only in health controls.  Current treatment for renal and vascular complications in DM patients includes blockade of the RAAS. Unfortunately, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II (AngII) receptor blockers (ARBs) lead to incomplete RAAS suppression, and do not completely prevent renal or vascular complications. Moreover, dual RAAS blockade increases renal and cardiovascular risk. Recent experimental work suggests that UA lowering therapies can block the RAAS, suppress inflammation and promote renal and systemic vascular protection. Therefore, our study is critical in determining the possible role of early UA lowering on renal and systemic hemodynamic dysfunction in young patients with T1DM.

Common symptoms include ocular discomfort, visual impairment and instability of the tear film with potential damage to the ocular surface.  In addition, an intact tear film is important to provide a smooth optical surface, to act as a barrier to pathogens, to nourish the epithelial cells of the ocular surface and to prevent exsiccation. Alterations in the tear film composition, which can have their origin in several conditions, lead to tear film hyperosmolarity or instability resulting in DES.  Regardless of the cause of DES, chronic dryness of the ocular surface leads to an increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, which is triggered by reactive oxygen species (ROS). This results in cell damage and activation of the immune system, keeping up inflammatory processes . In order to prevent ROS damage, several micronutrients such as vitamin C, E, and certain carotenoids, omega-3 free fatty acids, flavonoids and minerals have been used because of their antioxidant capacities.  Based on this knowledge the potential of these antioxidant dietary supplements has been discussed as a treatment option for DES. Preliminary data support the hypothesis that antioxidant supplementations, in particular, supplementation with omega 3 fatty acids may be beneficial for patients with DES.  The purpose of the present study is to test the hypothesis that treatment with dietary supplements improves subjective and objective symptoms of DES.

ROS	Unknown  	The Impact of EDCs Relative Markers and Reproductive Hormone in Taiwanese Women	Reproductive Aged.			https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01996631?term=ROS&rank=380	NCT01996631	Oxidative stress(OS), inflammation, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals(EDC) were all thought as important markers that will impact on female reproductive function. However, the cause-result correlations between above parameters were still unclear. Investigator plans to design a study to evaluate the OS, inflammation, and EDC and their impact on the menstrual cycle and reproductive hormone in Taiwanese women. Ferritin is a ubiquitous intracellular protein that is essential for the regulation of iron homeostasis. Serum ferritin level is a widely available clinical biomarker used to estimate body iron status. Iron is a strong pro-oxidant, and high body iron levels are associated with an increased level of OS that may elevate the risk of type 2 diabetes. Mildly elevated body iron stores are associated with statistically significant elevations in glucose homeostasis indexes. Furthermore, patients with elevated iron stores present not only insulin resistance but also metabolic alterations that put them at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Increased serum ferritin levels have been found in women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome(PCOS). Serum ferritin were highly correlated with menstrual cycle and androgens level in women. Homocysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid formed during the metabolism of methionine, exerts cytotoxic effects on the vascular endothelium. Hyperhomocysteinemia has been established as an independent risk factor for thrombosis and cardiovascular disease, and it may partially account for the increased risk of cardiovascular disease associated with insulin resistance. Elevated total plasma homocysteine levels have been established as an independent risk factor for thrombosis and cardiovascular disease. Studies related to homocysteine and PCOS have reported inconsistent results.  Chronic low-grade inflammation has emerged as a key contributor to the pathogenesis of PCOS and obesity. A dietary trigger such as glucose is capable of inciting OS and an inflammatory response from mononuclear cells of women with PCOS, and this phenomenon is independent of obesity. The correlation between inflammatory markers and reproductive endocrine disturbance and consequent complications should be important.Both OS and EDC had been associated with PCOS.  BPA, one of EDC, is an environmental estrogen used in the synthesis of plastics, is a "high-volume production" chemical with widespread human exposure. BPA was been reported in several female reproductive disturbance. However, the pathological pathway of BPA impact on female reproductive system had not been well-understood. Reactive oxygen species have a role in the modulation of gamete quality and gamete interaction. Persistent and elevated generation of ROS leads to a disturbance of redox potential that in turn causes OS. The first part of our study is aim to evaluate the OS impact on the biochemical parameters in women with PCOS; the secondary part of our study is to investigate the BPA on the clinical and biochemical of women with PCOS; finally, investigator plans to test the hypothesis that BPA might increase OS and then elevated ROS in women with menstrual disturbance, furthermore, the role of OS and BPA impact on insulin resistance and metabolic disturbance will be also investigated.  OS, inflammation, and EDCs are all important factors impact on the reproductive competence in women. To clarify above problems are critical importance. Investigator then conduct this study to demonstrate those problems. Study and control cases will be included. Serum total oxidant status, inflammatory biomarkers, total antioxidant status, BPA, and clinical/biochemical parameters will be obtained for all cases. OS and BPA will be evaluated with all clinical/biochemical parameters for all subjects.

The National Commission on Sleep Disorders estimates that 15 million Americans have OSA, many of whom remain undiagnosed (24). OSA is associated with the development of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases (1,2). Patients with OSA, like those with congestive heart failure, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes, exhibit impaired EDV (25-32). OSA is also associated with impairments in endothelium-dependent cerebral blood flow responses, which may be a risk factor for stroke (33). Impaired EDV is a result of reduced production or inadequate action of nitric oxide. Since EDV worsens with disease progression and improves with disease treatment, it serves as a prognostic marker of vascular function (34-37). In OSA, hypoxia and neurohumoral disturbances increase generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that neutralize nitric oxide and impair endothelium-dependent responses (9,10,38). One source of ROS in endothelial cells is the enzyme xanthine oxidase (38). XO is an enzyme present in the vascular endothelium that significantly contributes to generation of ROS in congestive heart failure, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes (13-17). Inhibition of XO improves endothelium-dependent resistance vessel responses in these populations (13-17), but it is unknown if XO significantly contributes to oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in OSA. The central hypothesis of this application is that inhibition of XO with allopurinol will reduce oxidative stress and generation of ROS, thereby improving nitric oxide bioavailability and EDV in OSA. Our hypothesis has been formulated on the basis that patients with OSA experience repeated hypoxemia that increases activity of XO and other enzymes, thus increasing the generation of ROS that negatively impact EDV. Hypoxia is detrimental to vascular homeostasis since it increases generation of ROS through direct mechanisms and via activation of XO.

However, studies have shown that only 1 out of 5 people with hypertension have their blood pressure controlled.  Diabetes is also an important risk factor for heart disease and stroke. About half of people with diabetes also have hypertension - a deadly combination. Studies have shown that only about 1 in 10 people with diabetes have their blood pressure controlled adequately - clearly something needs to be done to improve this.  Heart disease, stroke, hypertension, and diabetes are conditions that occur in the community, so we need to explore innovative solutions that will work in the community. Pharmacists are well-placed in the community to help identify people with diabetes and hypertension. This has worked very well in previous studies in patients with high cholesterol levels. Pharmacists and nurses have complementary skills which, when working as a team, may help identify and better manage hypertension in people with diabetes.  Our main objective is to test whether a community pharmacist and nurse team can improve blood pressure control in people with diabetes and hypertension.

The complications associated with missed or shortened dialysis sessions are serious and frequently require emergent medical care or hospitalization. Previous studies have shown that electronic messages have significantly improved attendance rates in a primary care setting, but these messages have not been validated in the chronic dialysis population.  An electronic intervention has been developed by Epharmix, a WUSTL IDEA Labs (ideas.wustl.edu) team, which has the capacity to use automated SMS text messages and/or phone calls to notify patients prior to each upcoming appointment, as well as alert a designated patient advocate. Patients receiving the messages are provided with key contact information for a dialysis rescheduling phone line, transportation resources, social work services, etc. They may also receive instructions on what to do if they are experiencing physical symptoms and need educational facts about dialysis. In particular, the intervention is designed to demonstrate to patients that the center cares and is concerned for their health and wellbeing. This intervention may potentially improve patient adherence to their scheduled sessions, increase patient satisfaction with their treatment, and prevent medical complications associated with missed dialysis appointments.  This study aims to determine whether an electronic intervention, which sends SMS text messages or phone calls of key dialysis treatment information, is able to improve dialysis treatment session attendance among dialysis patients with a history of poor attendance. We secondarily aim to identify the factors that may be barriers to dialysis treatment session attendance and the emergency department or hospital utilization associated with missed dialysis treatments.  Patients will be prospectively identified, recruited, and randomized into two groups. Group A will receive the electronic intervention prior to their appointments; Group B will not receive any electronic intervention. After 8 weeks, crossover will occur for both groups and the study will continue for an additional 8 weeks. Participants' clinic records will be reviewed to determine the numbers of missed and attended appointments, as well as records of ED visits and hospital admissions. Subjects will be asked to complete a post-study satisfaction questionnaire.

ROS	Completed	Anti-Oxidant Supplementation for the Prevention of Acute Mountain Sickness	Acute Mountain Sickness	Dietary Supplement: Anti-oxidant supplementation;   Dietary Supplement: Matched placebo for anti-oxidant supplementation	                Phase 3              	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00664001?term=ROS&rank=368	NCT00664001	Acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), and high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) are complications of rapid ascent to high altitude. Several features suggest that raised intracranial pressure (ICP) may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of AMS. Magnetic resonance imaging of HACE patients has demonstrated that the oedema in HACE is of the vasogenic, rather that cytotoxic, type. Thus it is likely that cerebrovascular permeability has an important role in the development of AMS and HACE.  Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to alter the permeability of the blood-brain barrier in severe ischaemia, causing vasogenic cerebral oedema. Endogenous antioxidant systems may have some capacity to respond to oxidative stress in hypoxia. The plasma concentration of urate, a powerful endogenous antioxidant, rises on acute exposure to high altitude and may play a crucial antioxidant role in systemic hypoxia. This antioxidant prevents free-radical induced cerebral oedema in animal models.  There are numerous sources of ROS in hypoxia, including the mitochondrial electron transfer chain, haemoglobin (Hb) autoxidation and xanthine oxidase activity. There have been several reports of raised markers of oxidative stress in humans at moderate altitude (<3000m).  Oral antioxidant supplementation with preparations containing vitamins C and E in humans at altitude has been shown to decrease breath pentanes (a marker of oxidative stress), and improve erythrocyte filterability. In a small randomised controlled trial, Bailey and Davies demonstrated a significant reduction in symptoms of AMS in subjects taking an oral antioxidant cocktail.  The antioxidants alpha-lipoic acid, vitamin C and vitamin E act synergistically to provide membrane protection from free radical damage, and may protect against hypoxia-induced vascular leakage. We hypothesised that this combination of antioxidants would reduce the severity of acute mountain sickness, and reduce pulmonary artery pressures, in healthy lowlanders acutely exposed to high altitude.

Although it is associated with a very small increase of gastric cancer risk, European Endoscopic Society and other European academic companies highlighted the increased risk of cancer in patients with gastric atrophy and IM and the need for staging in cases with high-grade dysplasia.  The production of ROS in the gastrointestinal tract (GI) and their role in the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases have not been studied sufficiently. In the plasma of patients, in the context of the sequence gastro oesophageal reflux-oesophagitis-metaplasia-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma, have been found simultaneous formation of DNA adducts and increased myeloperoxidase concentration, which are associated with oxidative stress, decreased antioxidant capacity (decreased glutathione concentration).These findings support the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis and malignant transformation.  Metabolic Syndrome (MS) has been recognized as a pro-inflammatory, pro-coagulant state associated with increased levels of C reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL) 6 and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) 1. It has been reported that the inflammatory and the pro thrombotic markers, which are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and DM2, represent only a part of the relationship between IM and cardiovascular mortality.  Several factors influence the pathogenesis of MS, as the pro-oxidant condition of such patients may increase the risk for developing symptoms and related chronic diseases such as DM2. Although the exact contribution of oxidative stress on every pathologic condition included in MS is difficult to determine definitively, it is certain that oxidative stress is particularly high in the MS.  Regarding the relationship between MS and GI diseases, studies have reported that patients with MS are almost twice at risk for developing Barrett's esophagus.The relationship between MS, gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), and the development of IM also requires well designed prospective studies.

Oxidative stress limits the functional competence of mammalian spermatozoa via lipid peroxidation, the induction of oxidative DNA damage and the formation of protein adducts. Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical generated from the oxidation of L-arginine to L-citrulline by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent NO synthases. Several studies suggest that the overproduction of this free radical and the subsequent excessive exposure to oxidative conditions have a potential pathogenetic implication, which due to the reduction of sperm motility.

For metastatic or unresectable melanomas, standard treatment options include immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., ipilimumab and nivolumab) and other therapies, however, approved therapies are rarely curative.  It is now well accepted that tumors are able to evade detection and eradication by the immune system, even though many tumor types, particularly melanoma, are capable of eliciting a strong immune response (Swann, 2007). Substantial mechanistic work in recent years has revealed the key role of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in masking cancer cells from the immune system, promoting both tumor progression and resistance to cancer immunotherapy. The immune-suppressive effect of MDSCs is dependent on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). High levels of these reactive molecules and their by-products, such as nitrotyrosine, have been correlated with poor clinical outcomes in melanoma. Currently available melanoma therapies do not target MDSCs.  In animals, RTA 408 significantly reduces tumor nitrotyrosine burden, inhibits the activity of MDSCs, and augments T-cell anticancer activity at relevant doses. Thus, through inhibition of MDSC activity and suppression of tumor ROS/RNS, RTA 408 may work in combination with T-cell-activating therapeutics such as ipilimumab to enhance the natural immune anticancer response. RTA 408 also has direct anticancer effects via inhibition of NF-kappa B. Chronic activation of NF-kappa B is associated with tumor progression, metastasis, and resistance to therapy.  This proposed study is designed to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) in combination with ipilimumab or nivolumab in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.  In this open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation, Phase 1b/2 study, patients who qualify will receive omaveloxolone (RTA 408) at the assigned dose level in combination with ipilimumab or nivolumab. Patients will receive omaveloxolone (RTA 408) orally once daily for 1 week prior to initiation of ipilimumab or nivolumab. For patients treated with ipilimumab , the run-in period will be followed by omaveloxolone (RTA 408) orally once daily in combination with ipilimumab administered at Weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10. After Week 10, patients will receive maintenance treatment with omaveloxolone (RTA 408) alone once daily. For patients treated with nivolumab, the run-in period will be followed by omaveloxolone (RTA 408) orally once daily in combination with nivolumab administered approximately every two weeks as clinically indicated. Each patient will continue at the assigned omaveloxolone (RTA 408) dose level until disease progression occurs, toxicity requiring discontinuation from study drug (i.e., RTA 408) is experienced, the patient has completed approximately 72 weeks of treatment, the patient is discontinued from the study drug for another reason, or the patient withdraws consent. Patients will return 4 weeks after omaveloxolone (RTA 408) treatment completion for a follow-up visit.  The starting omaveloxolone (RTA 408) dose level for the first dose-escalation cohort in this study has been selected based on available safety and pharmacodynamic data from a Phase 1 study of RTA 408 (NCT02029729). Subsequent cohorts will be enrolled at dose levels based on available safety and PD data from this study, but they will not be greater than 2-fold above the prior dose level.  Phase 1b (dose-escalation): In the phase 1b/2 portion of this study, 12 patients will be enrolled in each dose cohort, with six patients administered omaveloxolone (RTA 408) plus ipilimumab and the remaining six administered rTA 408 plus nivolumab. Subsequent cohorts will assess escalating the doses of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) administered in combination with ipilimumab or nivolumab. Dose escalation decisions will be based on ongoing review of all available safety information for enrolled patients.  Phase 2: The Phase 2 portion of the study may include separate expansion cohorts consisting of patients treated with either of the combination therapies. Each expansion cohort will include an additional 24 patients enrolled at the selected Phase 2 dose level to achieve a total of 30 patients at that omaveloxolone (RTA 408) dose in combination with ipilimumab or nivolumab.

The new therapy is called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for psychosis (PACT). PACT aims to help people:      Develop a sense of "mindfulness." Mindfulness allows you to be fully aware of your here-and-now experience, with an attitude of openness and curiosity. It is hoped that this will help reduce the impact of painful thoughts and feelings.    Take effective action that is conscious and deliberate, rather than impulsive. It is hoped that this will allow people to be motivated, guided, and inspired by the things that they value in life.    It is hoped that PACT will help to reduce the level of distress that individuals diagnosed with psychosis have been experiencing and help them to stay well in the future.

In fatigue patients, there are some evidences of oxidative damage to DNA. Ascorbic acid was known to protect mitochondrial injury against oxidative stress by depolarizing the mitochondrial membrane. The copy number of mitochondrial DNA(mtDNA) was suggested mitochondrial gene stability and biogenesis and reflected mitochondrial function. There is no evidence ascorbic acid would decrease the mtDNA damage in fatigue patients. The investigators hypothesized that decreasing in mtDNA copy number in salivary and blood sample may be reversed by high-dose vitamin C intravenous injection in fatigue patients. The investigators will compare the mtDNA copy number and fatigue scale between moderate-severe fatigue patients and control group that had not malignant and chronic illness by a randomized controlled trial.

ROS	Unknown  	The Influence of Obesity on Oocyte, Cumulus and Granulosa Functioning	BMI;   Lipid Profile			https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01945671?term=ROS&rank=388	NCT01945671	Obese women have a higher prevalence of infertility than their lean counterparts. Obesity is a risk factor for anovulation , including in response to gonadotropin treatment .Further, even in women who are cycling regularly, obesity is associated with increased time-to-pregnancy and decreased chance of natural pregnancy.  During obesity or periods of overnutrition, lipid accumulates in nonadipose tissues, notably skeletal muscle, liver, heart, and pancreas due to cellular uptake of exogenous fatty acids, triglycerides, and cholesterol as well as de novo lipogenesis in response to elevated glucose. The accumulation of intracellular lipid leads to high levels of free fatty acids that are subject to oxidative damage and the formation of cytotoxic and highly reactive lipid peroxides, which ultimately are detrimental to intracellular organelles, particularly the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. Exposure of the ER to high levels of free fatty acids and lipid peroxides causes structural alterations that perturb ER function and lead to accumulation of unfolded proteins and calcium release. Failure of the UPR to reestablish ER homeostasis can lead to apoptosis .When mitochondria are exposed to high levels of free fatty acids, these can become oxidized by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, forming lipid peroxides that damage essential proteins and uncouple mitochondrial function. This results in mitochondrial damage, which can cause further accumulation of lipids that cannot be catabolized, disrupted cellular homeostasis, and ultimately apoptosis .  The cellular mechanisms by which obesity causes decreased conception rates are not known. Based on extensive evidence of obesity-induced lipotoxicity in other cells, it was hypothesized that obesity results in the activation of lipotoxicity pathways in the ovary. It was shown that lipid accumulation, ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis occur in ovarian cells and the oocyte in response to a high-fat diet.  The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of high BMI on oocytes, granulose cells and metabolites in the follicular fluid.

ROS	Completed	Does Normal Brain Imaging Predict Normal Neurodevelopmental Outcome in Fetuses With Proven Cytomegalovirus Infection 	CMV;   Prenatal Diagnosis;   Ultrasound;   MRI			https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00872703?term=ROS&rank=420	NCT00872703	Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the largest member of the virus family Herpesviridae that infects almost all humans at some point in their lives (Ross, 2004). Congenital CMV infection is most likely to occur when the mother experiences a primary infection during pregnancy, and it is much less common in cases of reactivation of the disease or infection by a different CMV strain (Boppana 1999, Endres 2001). The prevalence of congenital CMV infection varies between 0.15-2.2% (Ross 2004, Ross 2006, Malm 2007). While most infants born with congenital CMV infection are asymptomatic, 10 to 15% show clinical findings at birth (Ross 2004).  It is generally agreed that congenital CMV infection, whether it is symptomatic or not, is a major risk factor for perceptual deficits. However, its influence on children's future neuropsychological functioning is less well established. Symptomatic congenital CMV infection is a major risk factor for poor developmental outcome (Williamson 1982, Kylat 2006, Dollard 2007), but the available data regarding neuropsychological outcome for asymptomatic children is extremely diverse (Conboy 1986, Ivarson 1997, Kashdan 1998, Temple 2000, Zhang 2007).  We evaluated the neuropsychological outcome of children with congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and normal consecutive fetal neurosonographic examinations and determined whether Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provided additional information in these cases.

ROS	Completed	Effects of Isoflavone Combined With Astaxanthin on Skin Aging	Ageing;   Photo-aging	Dietary Supplement: Isoflavone;   Dietary Supplement: Astaxanthin;   Dietary Supplement: Placebo		https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02373111?term=ROS&rank=418	NCT02373111	Photoaging is caused by the superposition of chronic ultraviolet (UV)-induced damage on the intrinsic aging process, and accounts for the majority of age-associated changes in skin appearance. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in UV-induced skin damage and diminish skin matrix protein levels, leading skin aging. Strategies utilizing endogenous skin antioxidants as well as plant-derived or synthetic compounds have been examined.  Astaxanthin mainly from marine algae and crustaceans is a kind of carotenoids which were well-known photo-protective agents with strong antioxidant activity. Several studies have revealed that supplementation of astaxanthin effectively protect skin against UV damage through free radicals.  In addition, matrix metalloproteinase-1 induced by UV irradiation is an important step toward skin aging. Recently, many studies pointed out that phytoestrogens exhibit agonistic and antagonistic estrogen activities, suppressing activity of MMP-1 in skin. Isoflavone is a kind of phytoestrogen from soybean and mainly act on skin and bones, inhibiting MMP-1 effectively.  The present study is designed to take isoflavone combined with astaxanthin to maximize their anti-aging ability and objectively measure the effects of the mixture on facial wrinkles, hydration, and elasticity.

Dysfunction of the vascular endothelium caused by oxidative stress might provide a mechanistic link. In acute and chronic inflammation, oxidative stress occurs when the production of reactive oxygen species [ROS] (including superoxide anions [O2-]) exceeds the capacity of the endogenous antioxidant defense systems, resulting in ROS-mediated damage. Recombinant human superoxide dismutase (rhSOD) has shown potent antioxidant properties in in-vitro and animal studies and has been tested in phase I clinical trials in humans. rhSOD could offer a therapeutic option for vascular dysfunction in diseases associated with increased oxidative stress. The investigators, therefore, want to test if the hyporesponsiveness to vasoactive drugs (norepinephrine, acetylcholine and glyceroltrinitrate) during acute inflammation by low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is due to the increased production of superoxide anions, which could be scavanged by the radical scavenger rhSOD.

Neutrophils and other inflammatory mediators like Interleukin-6 (IL6), Interleukin-8 (IL8), Interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha),Interleukin-1beta (IL-1 beta), Tumor Necrosis Factor alfa (TNF-alfa), Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), Leukotriene B4 (LTB4), Nitric Oxyde (NO) are implicated in the inflammation.    NO is produced in response to physical and chemical stress on bronchial epithelium and plays a critical role in small airways remodelling    Exhaled NO concentration is usually used to monitor bronchial inflammation    The relationship between stretch and strain of small airways and bronchial inflammation is not well understood.    The investigators hypothesis is that cyclic opening and closure of peripheral obstructed airways through the consequent stretching and strain acting on them can provoke an inflammatory response which can be monitored by exhaled NO.    The pharmacological effects of bronchodilators may play a role on bronchial inflammation by reducing the stretching stress on bronchiolar walls thus reducing the production of NO in exhalate    Data about these physiopathological aspects is missing in literature.

We hypothesize that oxidative stress (OS) and the formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS), which are part of the underling pathophysiology related to hyperthermia, can be used to identify tolerance/intolerance to heat. The aim of the present project is to develop a simple assay, based on specific designed sensitive biomarkers of OS that can be detected in a small blood sample, and to possibly correlate each individual's state of tolerance to heat to the level of OS. These biomarkers specially designed and synthesized to form a novel probe (not present as such in biological organs). The method will be based on the incubation of the suggested biomarkers with the patient's blood sample and the measurement of the level and type of oxidative alteration of the markers. For this goal, post heat stroke patients, with different levels of tolerance to heat and subjects during a process of acclimation to heat will be studied. Such a method will add to our ability to better determine the level of tolerance to heat and not rely only on the measurements of temperature and heart rate during an exercise-heat stress.

ROS	Unknown  	Verification of a Pharmacogenetic Approach to Customizing Chemotherapy to Asians	Colorectal Cancer			https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01596361?term=ROS&rank=415	NCT01596361	Interethnic variability in chemotherapy response is becoming increasingly evident, making approaches for customizing chemotherapy treatment to different ethnic populations desirable. At the same time, significant genetic variation has also been observed between ethnic groups, including many germline and somatic pharmacogenetic variants involved in chemotherapy pharmacology. Recently, based on meta-analyses of studies on germline pharmacogenetic variant frequencies and clinical trials, the investigators found that chemotherapy outcomes between Asians and Caucasians colorectal cancer (CRC) patients could potentially be inferred from the frequencies of variants between the ethnic groups and their respective biological functions. In this study, the investigators seek to further clarify the validity of using pharmacogenetic variants to customize chemotherapy between ethnicities through the following specific aims: (1) To verify the differences observed in the frequency of germline pharmacogenetic variants related to chemotherapy between Asian and Caucasian CRC patients, (2) To test whether variations in the frequency of somatic pharmacogenetic gene mutations between Asian and Caucasian CRC patients could be used to infer differences in clinical outcomes between the two ethnicities. (3) (4) For Aim 1, DNA samples from approximately 1000 Asian and Caucasian CRC patients each will be analyzed for the frequency of a panel of germline pharmacogenetic variants identified in our meta-analyses using high-throughput methodology. For Aim 2, meta-analyses will be performed on pharmacogenetic studies and clinical trials to establish the relative frequencies of somatic variants and clinical outcomes in Asian and Caucasian CRC patients. These frequencies will be verified on the same series of DNA samples used in Aim 1. The clinical outcomes inferred from the frequency differences and biological functions will then be compared to those summarized from clinical trials. This data could provide a basis for developing a rational approach to customizing chemotherapy in non-Caucasian populations and improve assessment of drug feasibility in different ethnic populations.If validated, this working hypothesis would be of high clinical interest, giving the opportunity to use this as a DNA prognosis biomarker in CRC.

We sought to investigate the impact of Catecholamine-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) polymorphism on the duration of vasodilatory shock and other important clinical outcomes in cardiac surgery patients.  COMT is a key enzyme in the degradation of catechols eg. catecholamines. 25% of the population have a low activity (L/L) of this enzyme. Sustained low COMT activity is associated with an altered metabolic profile of catecholamines and their degradation products.  The process of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)over-activates some of the same mechanisms the body uses to defend itself against severe infection. One of the main overactive defence mechanisms is the release of highly toxic compounds derived from oxygen - a process called 'oxidative-stress'. Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation can lead to inactivation of biologic mediators, including catecholamines. It is well established that some radicals autoxidizes catecholamines, including DA, NE, and epinephrine and contribute significantly to vasoplegia.  As part of this study, we will take six 2.7mL samples of blood, collected before, and after the operation, from the arterial catheter routinely inserted in every patient. This blood will be used to measure COMT genotype, the concentration of plasma-catecholamines as well as marker of oxidative stress.  Our plan is to enrol patients undergoing cardiac surgery if the use of the CPB is planned.

ROS	Completed	Aortic Cross-Clamping and Systemic Inflammatory Response in Humans: Effect of Ischemic Preconditioning	Aortic Aneurysm	Procedure: Remote ischemic preconditioning;   Biological: Blood drawn		https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02570464?term=ROS&rank=438	NCT02570464	Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surgery. It is postulated that aortic cross-clamping during open AAA repair may cause ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) leading to the systemic releases of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines which damage distant organs, including heart, kidney, and lung.  Ischemic preconditioning, first described in cardiac surgery, is a mechanism whereby tissues exposed to a brief period of nonlethal I/R develop resistance to subsequent ischemic insult. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC), is a phenomenon whereby brief periods of ischemia followed by reperfusion in one organ (usually skeletal muscle) provide systemic protection from prolonged ischemia. The mechanisms through which RIPC confer organ protection remains unclear.  The hypothesis is that limb RIPC would reduce systemic inflammatory mediators produced by ischemia-reperfusion and thereby protect the remote organs.  A single-center, prospective, randomized, parallel-group controlled trial is conducted on patients undergoing elective open infrarenal AAA repair. Written informed consent is obtained from each participant. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Rouen, France.  Patients are divided in two groups : the sham-operated control group underwent surgery without RIPC and the RIPC group : Two cycles of intermittent crossclamping of the common iliac artery (right or left) with 10 minutes ischemia followed by 10 minutes reperfusion served as the RIPC stimulus, before prolonged ischemia.  Blood samples are collected for analysis at the following time points: before surgery (baseline), 1, 3 and 24 h after cross-clamp release (reperfusion). The systemic inflammatory response is measured using the serum concentrations of TNF-alpha, and IL 1, 4, 6, 10. Cardiac, renal and pulmonary functions are evaluated with usual biological markers and clinical monitoring until 28 days after surgery.  Aortic surgery is a perfect clinical model of ischemia-reperfusion which makes it possible to study the impact of RIPC in humans. This biological approach would help to better understand the mechanisms underlying this technique.

ROS	Recruiting	Oxidative Stress and Endothelial Function in Pregnancy Complications	Pregnancy Complications;   Endothelial Dysfunction		mannaerts.dominique@gmail.com	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02603913?term=ROS&rank=437	NCT02603913	Pregnancy complications like pre-eclampsia (PE), pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH), intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) and preterm labor (PTL), (i.e. the major part of complications in pregnancy) are related to an impaired endothelial function. Endothelial dysfunction accounts for altered vascular reactivity, activation of the coagulation cascade and loss of vascular integrity. Nitric oxide (NO), a free radical molecule derived from L-Arginine by NOS (Nitric Oxide Synthase), is an endogenous endothelium-derived relaxing factor influencing endothelial function. In the placental circulation, endothelial release of NO dilates the fetal placental vascular bed and thus ensures feto-maternal exchange. The impaired endothelial function in pregnancy complications originates from production of inflammatory and cytotoxic factors by the ischemic placenta and results in oxidative stress and an altered bioavailability of NO. Measurement of endothelial function using peripheral artery tonometry and determination of ROS (reactive oxygen species) and RNS (reactive nitrogen species) using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) gives an idea of the oxidative stress that took place and the degree of endothelial dysfunction that occurred during pregnancy.

Post-operative atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common adverse event following CABG, experienced in 20-50% of patients; the highest incidence of AF occurs by the third post-operative day. Reduction of AF by various drugs is moderately effective, but involves either rate control with beta blockers or rate conversion with amiodarone after the myocardial damage processes initiating AF have already occurred. Decreasing the incidence of post-operative AF, and hence the morbidity and mortality of high-risk CABG patients, could be more fruitfully approached by targeting the upstream combined processes of inflammation and coagulation activation induced by the surgical insult and associated ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). We propose that cell damage induced by oxidative stress and I/R injury could be prevented and/or inhibited by antioxidant supplementation. Specifically the investigators hypothesize that high-dose intravenous (IV) vitamin C supplementation will ameliorate ROS and therefore damp down upstream inflammatory processes, leading to a reduction of downstream adverse events with demonstrable links to inflammation processes, such as AF.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are by far the most effective treatment with a broad anti-inflammatory spectrum. Nevertheless, most COPD patients and a proportion of severe asthma patients are corticosteroid-resistant (CR) and to fail to respond to ICS even when higher doses are given. These corticosteroid-resistant patients suffer from persistent symptoms and repeated asthma exacerbations. It has been suggested that smoking and oxidative stress may induce corticosteroid-resistance. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsible for oxidative stress can be generated exogenously (air pollutants, cigarette smoke) and endogenously by metabolic reactions. After inhaling air pollutants or cigarette smoke, the bronchial epithelium is exposed. Preliminary data from our own lab suggest that smoking and oxidative stress may decrease epithelial cell-cell contact formation. This results not only in a decreased barrier function, but also in an increased production of pro-inflammatory mediators.

Asthma is an inflammatory disorder of the airways. Airway inflammation is evident not only in patients with fatal asthma but also in mild asthmatics ( ). Oxidant stress, defined as inadequately controlled generation of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cells or tissues is a common feature of inflammation, and has also been documented in asthma ( , ). However, the current understanding of the relationship between the inflammation and the oxidant stress in asthmatic airways is poor. Does oxidant stress contribute to the expression of asthmatic phenotypes independently of inflammation  If so, could asthmatics benefit from supplementation of antioxidants  These questions have been nagging us since our laboratory provided credible evidence of oxidant injury in the airways of allergic asthmatics ( ).

ROS	Completed	Effects of Mud Bath Therapy in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)	Other: Mud bath Therapy	Fondazione Salvatore Maugeri	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01253941?term=ROS&rank=431	NCT01253941	Rehabilitation and physical therapy strategies targeting extra pulmonary manifestations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)are far from being well defined. Studies, performed in healthy subjects using threshold breathing device [a simple method to increase inspiratory muscle load] have shown that ventilatory muscle overactivation during loaded breathing may prime reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, thus initiating an inflammatory response that results in elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL_6. Increase of cytokine IL_6 in turn, elicits a cascade of systemic responses, involving hormone like glucoregulatory mechanisms, lipolysis and fat oxidation, as well as control of breathing.  Thermal mud bath therapy has been acknowledged for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in several chronic diseases. However, it is not considered among treatment options of chronic pulmonary disease. Previous experimental studies indicate that trace elements of thermal treatments, particularly iodide and bromide, may positively intervene in the setup and maintenance of active state in skeletal muscle. These findings suggest that in COPD patients these elements may improve the loading and endurance of respiratory muscles and therefore blunt ventilatory muscle overactivation and the ensuing inflammatory cytokine response.  In this study the investigators want to test two major hypotheses. First, that mud bath therapy reduces systemic inflammatory processes in COPD patients, increases respiratory muscle endurance and normalizes the ventilatory response. Second, that the increase in systemic inflammation after IRB exercise is blunted by mud bath therapy.

ROS	Unknown  	Randomized Controlled Trial of Insulin Versus Tablets for Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA)	Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults LADA	Drug: NovoMix 30;   Drug: Tablet treatment	Swansea University	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00776607?term=ROS&rank=432	NCT00776607	Background: Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults [LADA] is a type 1 diabetes that is slowly developing. This means many people are treated as having type 2 diabetes at diagnosis as they are adults who are not immediately insulin dependent. LADA can be distinguished from type 2 diabetes by antibody tests. Patients who are antibody positive have an autoimmune reaction which is similar to that of type 1 diabetes and is not found in type 2 diabetes. We would like to examine the best way of treating LADA in the early phase of the conditions, with tablets (similar to type 2 diabetes) or with insulin (similar to type 1 diabetes).  Methods/Design: This is an open parallel group prospective randomised trial. Participants need to have a GAD antibody test results of 101 WHO units or more and a diagnosis of diabetes not requiring insulin at diagnosis. Participants will need to have been diagnosed within 12 months and not treated with insulin at study entry. They will be randomised to receive either insulin (NovoMix 30) or tablets (diet treated followed by metformin followed by glitazone (with or without metformin) followed by insulin). Primary outcome assessment will be for change in HbA1c and change in fasting C-peptide over 24 months. Secondary outcome measures will include Quality of life, GAD antibody levels, adverse events, inflammatory markers, insulin resistance, and markers of the metabolic syndrome.  Discussion: This study seeks the best treatment for early LADA in terms of maintaining glycaemic control and maintaining natural insulin production.

ROS	Recruiting	A Novel Surgical Method in the Treatment of Unstable Vitiligo	Vitiligo	Procedure: Non cultured epidermal cell suspension;   Procedure: Non cultured dermal cell suspension		https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03013049?term=ROS&rank=447	NCT03013049	Vitiligo is a complex disease causing a selective, often progressive, loss of functioning melanocytes from epidermal basal layer resulting in white patches on the skin and occasionally mucosae. Worldwide prevalence of vitiligo is around 1% whereas in India it is around 3-4% ranging from 0.46% to 8.8%.  Etiopathogenesis of vitiligo is multifactorial consisting of genetic, immunological and environmental factors. Environmental and genetic factors act in concert to destroy melanocytes. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play important roles in vitiligo pathology,but the autoimmune pathogenesis has been proposed as one of the main causes of vitiligo.  Surgical methods, mainly transplantation of non cultured epidermal cell suspension are effective treatment for stable vitiligo. Transplantation of autologous noncultured epidermal cell suspension and non-cultured dermal cell suspension in combination (a mode of cellular grafting technique) is a novel surgical method for the treatment of vitiligo. Cytotoxic CD8+ ( cluster of differentiation 8+) cells in vitiligo perilesions may dictate the fate of transplantation, and strategies against CD8+ T cell activation might be beneficial for patients undergoing melanocyte transplantation. Mesenchymal cells could inhibit T cell proliferation and induce T cell apoptosis. Bartsch first identified and characterized dermal mesenchymal cells (DMCs). They have a multi-lineage differentiation potential into adipocytes, osteocytes and chondrocytes.Vitiligo patients' autologous melanocytes transplantation efficiency may be predicted by perilesional skin-homing CD8+ T cell activities, and the immunoregulatory DMCs might be used as auxiliary agent to improve the efficacy.  This pilot study is planned to compare transplantation of autologous noncultured epidermal cell suspension v/s its combination with non-cultured dermal cell suspension as a novel method in vitiligo surgery in stability of vitiligo with regards to extent of repigmentation, color matching of repigmented area, patient satisfaction and adverse events if any.

Newborns suffering from transposition of the great vessels who underwent at neonatal age an arterial switch operation (ASO) with coronary reimplantation, may develop in time with growth, stenosis, twist or elongation of the reimplanted coronary artery, which may cause myocardial ischemia. As well, aortic root surgery such as the Ross procedure and abnomalous coronary artery from pulmonary artery (ACAPA) reimplantation may lead to the same complications. Functional ischemic tests in a combination of three minimum are positive in only 75% of the cases . Silent ischemia due to coronary abnormality is to be detected in those patients.  In those patients, coronarography was recommended to be performed at least at 7 and 15 yo, without any clinical symptoms . It has also been recommended to examine those patients at 5, 10 and 15 yo as growth is the main cause for coronary abnormality development. Cardiac CT has been proven to be as efficient as coronarography to depict coronary reimplantation abnormalities .  Due to the invasiveness of angiography and to the development of cardiac CT, in our institution, the attitude is to performed cardiac CT instead of angiography with the same frequency in our patients.  Coronaro MRI has been established as a valid technique for evaluation of coronary arteries in patients after ASO .  The aim of this study is to evaluate if non contrast 3D MR coronarography is as powerful as Cardiac Multislice CT for the depiction of coronary anomalies.  All patients, with prior ASO, Ross or ACAPA reimplantation, refereed for cardiac CT and eligible for MRI, over 5yo are included in this prospective multi centric study.  Both examinations are performed on the same day after informed consent, from the patient or from both parents if minor.  Cardiac CT is performed according to the usual protocol in our institution, and MR coronaro angiography is performed as follow: excluding any contra indication to MR, the study requires one or two maximum 3D true FISP sequence without IV contrast injection, with cardiac gating, and free breathing.  3D images are evaluated blinded to the results of cardiac CT by two senior radiologists, with at least 5 years of experience in MR and CT cardiac imaging.  Comparison of the results is consolidated afterwards. Other elements evaluated are tolerance and feasibility of the examination.

The study aims to explore if the risk of fracture is reduced among type 2 diabetic subjects exposed to spironolactone and TZD. The study will compare the odds of any low impact fracture, and hand, foot, upper arm, wrist, and hip fracture incidence in subjects treated with TZD+spironolactone and TZD+amiloride compared to subjects treated with TZD only.  The study population will consist of type 2 diabetes patients aged 18 -65 years old exposed to TZD. To be eligible for the study, a subject must have had at least one International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9 code for type 2 diabetes and have at least 6 months or at least 12 months of exposure to TZD (rosiglitazone [RSG], pioglitazone [PIO] or troglitazone) during their follow-up time available in the database.

We want to explore the relationship of CIDP and corneal sensitivity. Our hypothesis is that people with CIDP have decreased corneal sensation compared to those without. We plan to perform a prospective study measuring corneal sensation in patients (proposed n=10) with CIDP and without to determine (1) if a difference exists in patients with CIDP compared to controls and (2) the magnitude of the difference. If a difference is detected in corneal sensitivity in patients with CIDP, this awareness amongst physicians and patients may help prevent blinding complications.

ROS	Active, not recruiting	Psilocybin Cancer Anxiety Study	Cancer	Drug: Psilocybin	                Phase 1                Phase 2              Co-Principal Investigator NYU Langone School of Medicine	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00957359?term=ROS&rank=453	NCT00957359	The primary objective of this double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study is to assess the efficacy of psilocybin administration (4-phosphoryloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine), a serotonergic psychoactive agent, on psychosocial distress, with the specific primary outcome variable being anxiety associated with cancer. Secondary outcome measures will look at the effect of psilocybin on symptoms of pain perception, depression, existential/psychospiritual distress, attitudes towards disease progression and death, quality of life, and spiritual/mystical states of consciousness. In addition, a secondary objective of the study is to determine the feasibility of administering psilocybin to this patient population, with regards to the following issues: safety, patient recruitment, consent for treatment, and retention. The duration of the proposed investigation will be long enough to administer the drug one time to each of thirty-two patients and to conduct follow-up assessments. This study is separate but similar to a recently completed study at the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, run by a psychiatrist, Dr. Charles Grob. Although the outcomes measures would be similar to those used as in the Grob study, the proposed dose of psilocybin is higher at 0.3mg/kg and the total subjects for the study would be 32 instead of 12. The study utilizes a cross-over design at 7 weeks and includes prospective follow-up of 6 months duration. This study has been approved by the Bellevue Psychiatry Research Committee, the NYU Oncology PRMC Committee, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through the issuance of an IND (77,138), the New York University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board (NYU IRB), the Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC)-New York University (NYU) Clinical Translational Science Institute (CTSI), the NYU Bluestone Center for Clinical Research, and the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) through the issuance of a schedule I license.  It is hypothesized that a one time experience with psilocybin will occasion dramatic shifts in consciousness and awareness that will lead to short-term (ie hours to days) and long-term (up to 6 months in this study, following the administration of the second dosing, either psilocybin or placebo) improvement in anxiety, depression, and pain associated with advanced cancer. The exact mechanism of action is unclear but based on studies done in the 60's using serotonergic hallucinogens in patients with advanced cancer, improvements in anxiety levels, mood and pain were reported. However, a treatment model developed by the famous British psychiatrist Humphrey Osmond, offers one possibility. In this model, serotonergic hallucinogens' therapeutic mechanism lies in their ability to allow the individual to access novel dimensions of consciousness and their efficacy or lack thereof relies on whether a transcendent and mystical state of awareness is attained. Another possible mechanism relates to what Dobkin de Rios and Grob have described as 'managed altered states of consciousness,' where the power of suggestibility, occurring in a safe setting, allows one to transcend a particular state of consciousness (i.e. anxiety and depression associated with advanced illness) as a means to facilitate emotional discharge and to manage irreconcilable conflict.

Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy	Genetic: mesenchymal stem cells	                Phase 2                Phase 3              	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02387749?term=ROS&rank=451	NCT02387749	A debilitating consequence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is neuropathy which globally affects between 20 -30% of diabetic patients and up to 50% in other studies. The incidence of diabetic neuropathy (DN) is estimated to be up to 45% for type 2 diabetic patients and 59% for type 1diabetic patients in USA.(DN) is the most common complication of DM. The risk of DN rises with age, duration of DM, and vascular disease. It is Characterized by damages in the arms and legs. The pathophysiology of DN is promoted by several risk factors: micro vascular disease, neural hypoxia, and hyperglycemia-induced effects At the molecular level, the primary cause of diabetic complications is known to be hyperglycemia, which disrupts cellular metabolism by the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).In the aspect of nerve functions, ROS formation increases neuron's susceptibility to damage. In addition, hyperglycemia impedes production of angiogenic and neurotrophic growth factors, which are necessary for normal function of neurons and glial cells and maintenance of vascular structure .The most common presentation of nerve damage due to the effects of hyperglycemia is neuropathic pain. (DN)may cause foot deformities such as hammertoes and unnoticed sores and infections in the numb areas of the foot. Improperly treated infection frequently extends to the bone and requires amputation of the foot.No definitive disease-modifying treatments have been to reverse DN. The current treatment focuses on tight glycemic control which can reduce potential risk factors for further nerve damage and DN-associated pain management. In many studies, deficiency of neurotrophic factors and lack of vascular support have been regarded as key factors in the development DN .Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are particularly attractive therapeutic agents because of their ability to self-renew, differentiate into multi lineage cell types , and locally secrete angiogenic cytokines, including basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) .These factors were reported to prompt neovascularization and have support for neural regeneration.MSC transfusion was reported to be a therapeutic agent in the treatment of Cardiovascular disease. Similarly, it was plausible that MSCs may also be an effective therapeutic agent for the DN treatment through the paracrine effects of bFGF (Shibata et al., 2008) and VEGF and their potential to differentiate into neural cells such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes , and Schwann cells.The adherent nature of MSCs makes them easy to expand in culture and an attractive candidate to use in cell therapy. Also, MSCs are particularly attractive therapeutic agents because of their ability to self-renew, differentiate into multi lineage cell types, and locally secrete angiogenic cytokines, including (bFGF) and VEGF. Therefore, cell therapy has recently emerged as an attractive therapeutic strategy to meet the needs of both neurotrophic and vascular deficiencies of DN.In electrodiagnostic studies, nerve conduction velocity and magnitude are measured by electrically stimulating nerves. Proper diagnosis of DN depends on the pattern of sensory loss, reflex test, electrodiagnostic studies, and imaging	[]	[]	Effect Of Mesenchymal Stem Cells Transfusion on the Peripheral Neuropathy in Diabetic Patients Measured by Nerve Conduction.

These congenital heart defects can directly affect the right ventricular ejection tract (RVOT), or sometimes indirectly, when the left ventricular ejection tract (LVOT) is replaced by the ROVT in a Ross operation. Originally introduced by Ross and Somerville in 1966, the reconstruction of ROVT by valved homografts is since then widely used.Pulmonary and aortic homografts then constituted the gold standard in conduit replacement between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery (VD-AP).  The increasing demand for homografts currently induces a shortage and unmet demands. This lack of availability, and the durability of homografts in young patients, has encouraged the search for alternative conducts.For example, in 1999, Medtronic  put a bovine jugular vein xenograft (VJB) on the market, the Contegra  conduct, as alternative for the homograft for RVOT reconstruction. This duct naturally has a central valve with three valvules, and there is on both sides of the valve a generous duct length allowing unique adaptation options. This conduit, however, is not perfect.  Whether using Contegra  ducts or homografts, replacement is inevitable. The aim of this study is to compare operative morbidity and mortality when replacing Contegra  or homograft.

ROS	Recruiting	Assessing the Value of Red Grapes Polyphenol Supplementation on Metabolic Parameters in Obese Insulinoresistant Subjects	Obesity;   Insulin Resistance;   Menopause	Other: Supplementation with red grapes polyphenol		https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02633150?term=ROS&rank=454	NCT02633150	Obesity, chronic disease, is a real public health problem because of its high prevalence but also because of the high risk of complications, including insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The mechanisms involved in the development of IR are not well known. Oxidative stress and inflammation induced by food overload could be the initiators IR mechanisms in skeletal muscle, responsible for the use of nearly 80% glucose in response to insulin and therefore plays a major role in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Thus, an increase in ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species), markers of oxidative stress and chronic low-grade inflammation have been demonstrated in subjects with obesity, the latter decreasing in weight loss. Therapeutically, loosing weight is still very difficult these days, because of the complexity of this chronic disease. Thus, it is well established that restrictive diets to expose weight rebound, dramatic medically as in human terms for these patients. Support for physical activity is also difficult because of reduced mobility in patients, refer to the lack of motivation among some. Finally, investigators have no treatment "against-obesity" who have demonstrated a benefit / risk enough to be used routinely. It is therefore essential to seek other means of struggle against the IR, see help in weight loss.  In parallel, it is well established that the consumption of certain antioxidants, including polyphenols (PP) grape as extracts and whole foods, modulates favorably several pathways responsible for the development of IR in cell models animals. The results of antioxidants supplementation in humans are few and controversial. However, most supplementation studies in human used a PP, Resveratrol at supra nutritional doses (ie not compatible with a balanced diet of fruits and vegetables). In a previous study, investigators tested the interest of a supplementation with red grape PP nutritional doses in healthy subjects with metabolic risk (overweight subjects and related to the first degree of T2DM patients) on IR hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp measured. During this study, the PP have prevented the central mechanisms of muscle IR that are oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by a load fructose.  For this project, investigators propose to test the effect of a red grape PP supplementation at nutritional doses for 8 weeks on IR and weight loss in 30 obese insulin resistant. This is a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled. This supplementation will be associated with a standard support for their obesity performed routinely in the Nutrition and Diabetes unit.  Specific inclusion criteria: Female or male nondiabetic 50-65 years, BMI> 30 kg / m2 and with a HOMA> 3.  The main objective is to test whether supplementation PP improves systemic insulin sensitivity (GIR: rate glucose infusion) measured by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (gold standard for measuring insulin sensitivity) in insulin-resistant obese subjects.  Secondary objectives are to:      Test whether supplementation PP improves insulin sensitivity to tissue (fat and muscle) and compare the response to supplementation in these two tissues.    Determining the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in improving IR: regulation of inflammation, oxidative stress.    Determine whether supplementation PP optimizes weight reduction compared to a standard single support.    NSN: The number of subjects required was evaluated from our previous work (2013 Hokayem et al.) Whose main objective was to assess the impact of PD versus placebo in first degree relatives of patients with diabetes type 2. Under a bilateral alternative hypothesis of a nonparametric test (Mann-Whitney), 1: 1 ratio, a power of 80% and an alpha risk of 0.05, the number of subjects was estimated at 15 per group.  Methodology: Anthropometric measurements, assessment of body composition (DEXA) system application characterization (metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, adipokines and insulin sensitivity: clamp hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic, lipopolysaccharides: LPS) / tissue characterization (biopsies of skeletal muscle and tissue adipose): insulin sensitivity, inflammation, oxidative stress, gene regulation (sirt1), mitochondrial activity / cell characterization (adipocyte precursor and muscle) insulin sensitivity, inflammation, oxidative stress, sirt1.  Investigators hope to demonstrate that a non-pharmacological treatment based on nutritional doses of PP supplementation can improve insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant obese patients, refer to optimize weight loss compared to a standardized management of obesity and determine the mechanisms involved.

It is the eighth most common incident cancer and the sixth leading cause of cancer death in the world. In Taiwan, esophageal cancer was newly diagnosed in 2199 patients and was the cause of 1507 deaths in 2011. Squamous cell carcinoma is the predominant histological tumor type, accounting for about 90% of the cases. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is an aggressive disease, characterized with extensive local growth and frequent metastases. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with or without surgery is the treatment option for locally advanced ESCC. Further, target therapy is used in conjunction with CCRT and surgery in ESCC since several years ago. However, the therapeutic outcomes are not satisfactory due to the emergence of chemo-radioresistance. It is imperative to investigate new biomarkers and to find novel treatment targets in ESCC.  A small population of tumor-initiating cells or cancer stem cells (CSCs) possess some biological functions like normal stem cells, including self-renewal, asymmetric cell division, slowly proliferation rate and drug-resistance. CSCs from many primary tumors and cell lines express specific stem cell markers, including Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, CD133 (promimin-1), Nestin, CD44 ,CD24, ALDH (Aldehyde dehydrogenase) and c-Kit. There are many evidences that CSCs are responsible for tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. CSCs are also believed to have important roles in cancer recurrence due to their resistance to anti-cancer drugs and radiation. CSCs express high levels of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. ABC transporter can pump cytotoxic drugs out of cells and is one important mechanism of multidrug resistance in CSCs. In addition, CSCs have high reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger expression to remove ROS produced from irradiation therapy.  Fursultiamine (also known as thiamine tetrahydrofurfuryl disulfide, TTFD) is a derivative of vitamin B and currently used for nutrition supplement. The investigators have identified that Fursultiamine suppressed OCT-4, SOX-2, NANOG expression and decreased ABCB1 and ABCG2 in tumor sphere of ESCC cell lines. In this project, the investigators will conduct a prospective phase II study to investigate the effect of Fursultiamine combined with CCRT in ESCC patients. Stem cell markers in clinical specimens collected before and after CCRT will be evaluated.

Its incidence is increasing partly due to the ageing population and it has been referred to as a growing epidemic. AF results in irregular contractions of the heart causing unpleasant symptoms of palpitations and increasing the risk of stroke, heart failure and death. Percutaneous catheter ablation is a safe treatment option in symptomatic patients with AF. The success rate of these procedures have improved with time due to our better understanding of AF, development of new techniques and technology, and greater physician experience. However, the success rate of these procedures still only remains around 70%. This is contributed to our limited ability to find the areas that drive the AF.  STAR mapping is a novel mapping system that has been developed with a view of better identifying the sites that drive AF, through taking into account the mechanisms of AF that have already been demonstrated. Data from this study will be used to refine the identification of drivers in the fibrillation left atrium with enormous potential to simplify ablation and improve success rates and thereby reducing the need for further procedures.  To better validate this mapping system the investigators also aim to use it in participants with atrial tachycardia (AT), which is a heart rhythm abnormality of which the mechanism can be readily identified with the existing mapping systems used in clinical practice. The investigators will demonstrate that the STAR mapping algorithm can effectively map AT.  To gain further understanding of the changes that occur in the left upper chamber of the heart in the context of AF half of the participants with AF will undergo cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to assess for the presence of scar. This will enhance our understanding of how atrial remodelling promotes AF, which may point to ways of modifying this process and preventing AF.

Mothers will receive the 23 valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23vPPV) either: a) during the third trimester of pregnancy; b) soon after child birth; or c) seven months after child birth (control group). The adult diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis vaccine (dTPa) will be used as the control vaccine for the birth dose.  The study aims to recruit 210 Indigenous women aged 18-39 years who have an uncomplicated pregnancy. Following recruitment, subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups.  Each mother and infant will be followed from pregnancy until the baby is seven months of age. Children will receive all of their routinely recommended vaccinations in accordance with the standard vaccination schedule.  The primary outcome will be prevalence of ear infection at seven months of age, defined as middle ear effusion or tympanic membrane perforation or acute otitis media. Pneumatic otoscopy, video-otoscopy and tympanometry will be used in the ear examinations. The primary analyses will be a direct comparison of the proportion of infants in the control group who have nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine type pneumococci at seven months of age compared to infants in each of the other two groups and a similar comparison of the proportion with middle ear disease.

FQ capitalizes upon the healthcare visit as an opportunity for intervention, consistent with the finding that approximately 70% of smokers visit a primary care physician each year. Successful integration of quitlines into healthcare delivery will transform regular healthcare visits into easily implemented, cost-beneficial avenues via which smokers all across America will be routinely inducted into effective cessation intervention. F2Q will be evaluated as follows:      Does F2Q increase contacts and "quality contacts," between the quitline and patients who smoke and receive health care at a participating clinic  A "quality contact" is defined as a quitline referral that results in the individual enrolling in the quitline counseling services. This aim will be assessed by measuring the rates of quitline referrals in 49 clinics before and after F2Q has been implemented.    Are contact rates and enrollment rates of F2Q increased by "Enhanced Academic Detailing" at clinic sites (with enhanced academic detailing comprising ongoing training/technical assistance as well as performance feedback)     What are the features of the Fax to Quit (F2Q) and Fax to Quit plus Enhanced Academic Detailing (F2Q + EAD) interventions that key clinic personnel found helpful and easy to implement, as well as features that were unhelpful and difficult  This information will be gathered in qualitative assessments that also will identify clinic strategies and organizational features that facilitated successful implementation.    What are the incremental costs of instating and sustaining F2Q and F2Q + EAD and how do these costs compare to other quitline promotional strategies (e.g., paid media, medication give-away programs)   	United States, Wisconsin || Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention || Madison, Wisconsin, United States, 53711	[]	An Evaluation of the Fax to Quit Program and Wisconsin Tobacco Quitline Utilization by Southeastern Wisconsin Clinics
ROS	Recruiting	Lung Fluid and Peripheral Blood Neutrophil IL-5 Surface Receptor in Children With Asthma	Asthma	Procedure: Bronchoscopy	kww7d@hscmail.mcc.virginia.edu	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02866487?term=ROS&rank=474	NCT02866487	The pattern of lower airway inflammation in asthma is heterogeneous, but in many patients, the polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) is the predominant granulocyte infiltrating the airspaces. Although it is known to have an important function in innate immune defense, the role of the PMN in asthma has not been well elucidated. In work in progress, the investigators have identified the receptor for IL-5 on the surface of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) PMNs in a subset of children with severe, treatment-resistant asthma, a characteristic that is not found in peripheral blood neutrophils. While the function of this IL-5 receptor has yet to be determined, preliminary evidence strongly supports a mechanism linking neutrophilic with type 2 inflammation in the lower airways of children with asthma, a discovery that has exciting potential to modify the treatment of asthma.  The primary objective of this observational cross-sectional study is to test the overall hypothesis that therapeutic intervention directed against the IL-5R on lung PMNs will decrease inflammation and improve clinical outcomes in patients with poorly controlled asthma. The secondary study objective is to demonstrate that IL-5R expression on lung-infiltrating PMNs is functional, will activate known IL-5R-induced signaling pathways, and will lead to enhanced PMN pro-inflammatory activity including increased PMN recruitment, prolonged survival, degranulation, and release of reactive oxygen species.

They can not only prolong the stay in intensive care unit and in hospital but also increase the morbidity and mortality rate. The underlying mechanisms are multifactorial, however, oxidative stress following hepatic ischemia reperfusion and the ensuing pulmonary leukocyte infiltration play an important part in the pulmonary complications. Various drugs and methods such as ischemic preconditioning have been used to lessen the production of oxidative free radicals following hepatic ischemia reperfusion. The choice of different anesthetic agents could aslo change the degree of production of oxygen species and antioxidant capacity during the operation.  Volatile and intravenous anesthetic agents can decrease oxidative injuries through different mechanisms, however, which is better in preventing the pulmonary leukocyte infiltration is still unknown.  We attempt the compare the oxidative stress and cytokine level in liver transplant recipients under desflurane or propofol anesthesia to evaluate which kind of anesthetic agent is better in this kind of surgery.

Iron is also characterized as a potent pro-oxidant, as it can lead to increased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) that are involved in critical biological processes, such as gene expression, signal transduction and enzyme activity. In exercise, low levels of RONS are essential for optimal force production, whereas excessive production of RONS can cause contractile dysfunction, resulting in muscle weakness and fatigue. On the other hand, RONS are involved in signaling pathways and up-regulation of the expression of several genes, and therefore, RONS can provoke favorable effects such as training adaptations.  The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effect of iron supplementation on redox status, muscle damage and muscle performance after an acute bout of a valid muscle damaging eccentric exercise model in adults and children.

It may cause unpleasant symptoms as well as increases the person's risk of stroke and heart failure. With an ageing population, increasing rates of AF and limited access to specialists, new methods of care, like nurse practitioners (NP) need to be assessed to meet patient specific needs and provide sustainable care.  The objective of the project is to evaluate the effect of Nurse Practitioner-led care in people with AF on their quality of life.  The Canadian Healthcare system is overwhelmed, with increasing costs and wait times. Contributing to these issues, is AF is the most common arrhythmia accompanied with costly complications including stroke and heart failure. Currently family or emergency room physicians ask general cardiologists or specialized cardiologists, to provide care to patients with AF. Unfortunately, there is limited access to their services. NP's are nurses who have taken extra education at University to treat patients and prescribe medications. This research project involves an NP who has specialized training in AF patient management.  By utilizing an NP to provide care for patients with AF, the investigators hope to improve patient's quality of life and satisfaction with care. This may also reduce complications of AF.

Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) (Resick & Schnicke, 1996) is a well-established and efficacious evidence-based psychological treatment for PTSD in both civilian and veteran populations (Forbes et al., 2012; Monson et al., 2006; Resick et al., 2008; Resick, Nishith, Weaver, Astin, & Feuer, 2002). The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) includes CPT among the first-line treatments for PTSD (National Center for PTSD, 2012). A modified protocol without the utilization of written exposure (CPT-C) may be more effective than the original protocol. However, despite such promising evidence, individuals who experience chronic nightmares and sleep problems tend to show smaller gains and persistent nightmares following PTSD treatment (Nappi, Drummond, & Hall, 2012). Given that nightmares are considered the hallmark of PTSD (Ross, Ball, Sullivan, & Caroff, 1989) and their treatment-resistant nature (Davis & Wright, 2007), specific psychological treatments have been developed to target sleep disturbances and nightmares.  Exposure, relaxation, and rescripting therapy (ERRT) is a promising psychological intervention developed to target trauma-related nightmares and sleep disturbances. Though further evidence is needed, ERRT has exhibited strong support in reducing the frequency and intensity of nightmares, as well as improving overall sleep quality in both civilian and veteran samples. In addition, significant decreases in PTSD and depression symptoms have been reported following treatment (Davis et al., 2011; Davis & Wright, 2007; Long et al., 2011; Swanson, Favorite, Horin, & Arnedt, 2009). ERRT is currently an evidence-level B suggested treatment (Cranston, Davis, Rhudy, & Favorite, 2011).  There is a call to research suggesting the importance of treatment studies which focus on interventions that integrate nightmare and sleep symptom treatment with evidence-based treatment for PTSD (Nappi et al., 2012). In an effort to respond to this call, we propose to tailor ERRT for use in conjunction with CPT, and preliminarily test ERRT's additive effect to CPT in treating PTSD in community outpatients. We hypothesize that ERRT would increase CPT's treatment efficacy by its specific focus on trauma-related nightmares and sleep disturbances. Sleep difficulties are known to increase tension, and reduce one's ability to cope adaptively (Bonn-Miller, Babson, Vujanovic, & Feldner, 2010; Hofstetter, Lysaker, & Mayeda, 2005; Nishith, Resick, & Mueser, 2001). Thus, with improved sleep an individual may have additional personal coping resources for which s/he can use to address the broader trauma issues (Nappi et al., 2012). To test this integration, we will compare ERRT + CPT, CPT + ERRT, and CPT alone.

Pathophysiologic mechanisms of contrast-induced nephropathy(CIN) is not entirely clear yet. May be associated with renal hemodynamic changes, medullary ischemia because of renal blood flow reduction, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction ,contrast agents damage the epithelium of renal tubular directly and so on. Currently the studies have proved that inflammation(CRP, TNF-¦Á and NF- B) played a role in CIN.It is well-know that the hyperhomocysteinemia(HHCY) is a independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, which has pro-inflammatory effects. Researches showed that Hcy stimulated CRP generation by the NMDAr-ROS-ERK1 / 2 / p38-NF- B signaling pathway and triggered inflammatory response. We will compare the CIN incidence of different plasma Hcy levels in adults hypertensive patients undergoing coronary artery diagnosis and treatment(CAG and PCI). CIN was defined as an absolute ¡Ý0.5mg/dl or a relative ¡Ý25% increase in the serum creatinine level at 48 hours after the procedure. The relationship between decreased plasma Hcy levels and blood pressure values by using Enalapril Maleate and Folic Acid Tablets(as the program-based antihypertension) and recovery of CIN has been observed. Using univariate and multivariate Logistic regression to analyse the relationship between HHcy and CIN, and taking receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to select the best Hcy plasma levels that which can predict the CIN and the probability. This study will help us to understand the relationship between HHcy and CIN that course of the procedure in adults hypertensive patients, preoperative plasma Hcy levels can predict the incidence of CIN and whether Enalapril Maleate Folic Acid tablets can reduce the CIN of hypertensive patients with HHcy. Which has important clinical significance. This study also offer feasibility for further research that HHcy plays a role in pathogenesis and specific signaling pathways of CIN.

ROS	Completed                Has Results	Targeting Sympathetic Overactivity in Heart Failure Patients With Statins	Heart Failure	Drug: Simvastatin;   Drug: Placebo	University of Missouri-Columbia	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01097785?term=ROS&rank=492	NCT01097785	Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States with the incidence and prevalence of the disease on a continual rise. An overactive sympathetic nervous system has become a hallmark characteristic of HF. Although sympathetic activation is initially beneficial to maintain cardiac output, blood pressure and perfusion to vital organs, over the long term it becomes deleterious contributing to the worsening of HF and sudden cardiac death. Indeed, recent findings in HF patients suggest that the sympathetic overactivity is not just a marker of poor prognosis but it plays a causative role in the development of the disease. Thus, the sympathetic nervous system constitutes a putative drug target in the treatment of HF. However, despite aggressive medical management, including conventional anti-adrenergic strategies, sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) has been shown to remain abnormally high in HF patients and improvements in survival have been limited. Thus, other treatment strategies that include reducing SNA and its deleterious consequences are warranted. Recent findings from clinical trials indicate that 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) improve survival irrespective of cholesterol lowering bringing the pleiotropic (i.e., cholesterol independent) effects of statins to the forefront. An important pleiotropic effect recently reported in experimental HF, that has yet to be directly tested in human HF, is the ability of statins to reduce resting sympathetic outflow. Several studies in pacing-induced HF rabbits have demonstrated that statins normalize the excessive sympathetic activation in the HF state. Thus, the goal of this project is to determine whether these findings in experimental HF can be translated to the clinical setting of human HF. Our central hypothesis is that statins reduce sympathetic overactivity in HF patients. To test this hypothesis we will directly measure muscle SNA and perform a randomized crossover placebo control study. Subjects will come to the research laboratory before and after the administration of Simvastatin at a standard therapeutic dosage of 40 mg. per day or placebo for 1 month	United States, Missouri || University of Missouri || Columbia, Missouri, United States, 65212	[]	Targeting Sympathetic Overactivity in Heart Failure Patients With Statins

Because it affects multiple systems and induces physiological, immunological and psychological changes. Previous literature showed surgical injury induces a systemic inflammatory metabolic-endocrine response that is proportional to the severity of the surgical stress. In surgeries such as liver transplantation, the patients suffer not only from postoperative pain but also an additional oxidative stress caused by ischemia reperfusion. Previous report have proved that an adequate postoperative pain control improves the recovery and reduces the inflammatory cascade by suppression of physiological and psychological stresses. However, the effect of postoperative pain management on ischemia reperfusion injury is unclear so far. In this three year study, we plan to continue our previous study to test the following two hypothesis: (1) postoperative pain exacerbate remote organ injury caused by ischemia reperfusion, (2) the interaction of different antinociceptive modalities on ischemia reperfusion injury.

On a molecular level, at least five major pathways have been implicated in glucose-mediated vascular and renal damage and all of these could reflect a single hyperglycaemia-induced process of overproduction of reactive oxygen species.  Recent studies have shown that inflammation, and more specifically pro-inflammatory cytokines play a determinant role in the development of micro- vascular diabetic complications, most of the attention has been focused on the implications of TNF-¦Á in the setting of diabetic nephropathy.  Glutathione is the most abundant low-molecular-weight thiol, and Glutathione/ glutathione disulfide is the major redox couple in animal cells.  N-acetylcysteine is effective precursors of cysteine for tissue Glutathione synthesis.  Not only does N-acetylcysteine exhibit antioxidant properties, but it may also counteract the glycation cascade through the inhibition of oxidation.  N-acetylcysteine can also reduce the apoptosis elicited by reactive oxygen species .  Indeed, N-acetylcysteine has been shown to inhibit reactive oxygen species induced mesangial apoptosis and to be able to protect cells from glucose-induced inhibition of proliferation.

Effective treatment and rehabilitation of depression, and other neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, relies on neuroplasticity. Thus, identifying therapies that enhance neuroplasticity (neuroplastic adaptation) are vital in the comprehensive treatment of depression. Aerobic exercise training has been demonstrated to have antidepressant properties and single bouts of aerobic exercise may provide short-term improvements in affective states in depression. Furthermore, acute aerobic exercise may enhance the response to known neuroplasticity-inducing paradigms. However, it is unclear if aerobic exercise can influence neuroplasticity in depression and the neurobiological mechanisms underlying acute neuroplastic changes are not well understood in depressed and healthy cohorts. Thus, the purpose of this project is to examine the acute effects of aerobic exercise on neuroplastic, neurobiological, and mood indices of depression.

However, when multiple organ failure occurs, the mortality rate of patients increases dramatically. Therefore, the major goal in the intensive care unit is to prevent the occurrence of multiple organ failure. The sepsis protocol and early goal directed treatment have great effects to reduce development of multiple organ failure and to decrease the mortality rate. However, sometime the condition of patient deteriorated in spite of both the mean blood pressure and mixed venous oxygen saturation are normal. Some experts recognize that there might be microcirculatory dysfunction of tissue or organ. The dysfunction of microcirculation might due to vasoconstriction or microthrombosis. Vasoconstriction might result from systemic inflammation, reactive oxygen species, or dysfunction of synthesis of NO (nitric oxide). Microthrombosis might result from systemic inflammation, reactive oxygen species, imbalance of coagulatory system, or damage of endothelial cell.  In clinical practice, the oxidative stress is related to circulatory shock, sepsis, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. This study tries to investigate the relation between oxidative stress and microcirculation. Furthermore, the investigators will try to investigate the correlation between the severity of oxidative stress and microcirculatory dysfunction and the severity of disease and prognosis. The investigators hope this study will help them to figure out the picture of disease progression of patients. It may conduct further study to modulate the oxidative stress, to improve the microcirculatory function, and finally to improve the outcome of patients.

Approximately 70% of patients with SLE will develop cutaneous involvement at some point during course of their disease. In spite of the esthetic consequence during the acute phase, the main problem is still related to its disfiguring and incapacitating nature. Topical steroids and/or antimalarial therapy continue to be the conventional therapy. Unfortunately, approximately 30% will be refractory to these measures. For those patients, immunosuppressive therapy can be an alternative with controversial results. Several series have shown a 90% of clinical efficacy in patients treated with Thalidomide. Unfortunately, the main drawback has been the serious described side effects such as fetal malformations, polyneuropathy and drowsiness. Recently, a new thalidomide analogue, more potent, efficient and with better safety profile has been discovered. The main objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lenalidomide for patients with Refractory cutaneous Lupus. Secondary objectives include evaluating the effect of this drug on the systemic manifestations of lupus disease, the adverse effects, frequency of flare after withdrawal, the sequela and the effect on the seric parameters.

Recent work has identified the use of plant protection agents by farmers as a risk factor for developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common histology. Different biological models were used to understand the role of pesticides in lymphomagenesis. To summarize, most pesticides act at the cellular and molecular level, on different signaling pathways. After metabolized by cytochrome P450, these compounds generally become pro-oxidants. The increase in reactive oxygen species rate (SAR) causes the activation of signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival. But deregulation of oxidative status does not in itself justify the specificity of the impact of pesticides on specific pathologies. Several agents have a genotoxic effect, others induce the activation of signaling pathways by binding to transcription factors and others have immunomodulating properties.

Fenretinide is an anticancer agent that may work differently than standard chemotherapy medicines. It may cause the buildup of wax-like substances in neuroblastoma cancer cells, called "ceramides" or other chemicals, called 'reactive oxygen species'. In laboratory studies it was found that if too much ceramide or reactive oxygen species build up in neuroblastoma cells, they may die.  In addition, researchers are testing to see if a drug called ketoconazole, commonly used to treat fungus infections, can increase fenretinide levels in the body by interfering with the body's ability to break down fenretinide.  This study is being done: 1) to allow patients with recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma patients who would otherwise not be able to access fenretinide/LXS oral powder for treatment to do so; 2) to further describe the side effects of fenretinide and ketoconazole when given by mouth for seven days every three weeks; 3) to determine if a patient's tumor gets smaller after treatment with fenretinide oral powder plus ketoconazole or fenretinide oral powder alone.

Mothers will receive the 23 valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23vPPV) either: a) during the third trimester of pregnancy; b) soon after child birth; or c) seven months after child birth (control group). The adult diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis vaccine (dTpa) will be used as the control vaccine for the birth dose.  The study aims to recruit 210 Indigenous women aged 17-39 years who have an uncomplicated pregnancy. Following recruitment, subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups.  Each mother and infant will be followed from pregnancy until the baby is seven months of age. All routinely recommended vaccinations on the standard vaccination schedule will continue to be offered by the subject's vaccine provider in accordance with current clinical practice.  The primary outcome will be prevalence of middle ear disease at seven months of age, defined as middle ear effusion or tympanic membrane perforation or acute otitis media. Pneumatic otoscopy, video-otoscopy and tympanometry will be used in the ear examinations. The primary analyses will be a direct comparison of the proportion of infants in the control group who have nasopharyngeal carriage of one or more vaccine type pneumococci at seven months of age compared to infants in each of the other two groups. A similar comparison of the proportion with middle ear disease will be undertaken between the control group and the respective intervention group.

OncoSil , is an experimental treatment and carries the active treatment "radioactive Phosphorous (32P)" inside inactive silicon particles. Once implanted, the OncoSil  Microparticles will stay in the tumour permanently. The purpose of OncoSil , is to deliver the action of 32P directly into a targeted tumour to destroy cancer cells. Patients will be taking part in a single arm open label research study - which means that everyone in the research study will receive the investigational treatment OncoSil , plus their prescribed standard chemotherapy regimen which will be either; FOLFIRINOX (FOLFIRINOX is the name of a combination of chemotherapy drugs used to treat advanced cancer of the pancreas) or gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane).Participation in this research study involves a Screening Period, a Treatment Follow Up Period and a Long Term follow up period. At the first screening visit, every patient will be asked to sign a consent form to agree to the study procedures, before any assessments are performed for the study. The total number of visits patients will need to attend will depend on how long it takes for their disease to progress. The implantation of OncoSil  will be completed in the endoscopy suite of the hospital under endoscopic ultrasound. This allows the specialist doctor to view the pancreas and enables them to implant the OncoSil Microparticles via a fine needle directly into the target tumour. After the procedure, there will be a 4 hour observation period to ensure that the patient is feeling fine and safe to go home. Implantation will only occur once during the treatment period, and once implanted, the device cannot be removed. After the patients target tumour shows progression on imaging, there will be an end of study visit and then the Long Term follow up period will be conducted. The Long Term Follow up does not require the patient to return to the research study site, it is done via review of the patient's medical records by site staff every 8 weeks for a maximum of up to 30 months.

ROS	Recruiting	The Effect of Problem Solving Therapy and Antidepressant Therapy on Cerebral Perfusion and Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) in Depressed Elders	Major Depressive Disorder	Behavioral: problem solving therapy;   Drug: Sertraline	craign@lppi.ucsf.eduUniveristy of California San Francisco, Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01305889?term=ROS&rank=528	NCT01305889	The focus of this study is to gather preliminary data regarding the effects of a psychological therapy¡ªProblem Solving Therapy¡ªand an antidepressant medication¡ªsertraline¡ªon 1) cerebral perfusion (CP), 2) brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and 3) measures of cognitive function in subjects with late life major depression (LLMD). This research goal will be achieved by recruiting 38 individuals over the age of 65 with LLMD. The primary outcomes will be change in CP, change in BDNF, and change in cognitive measures from baseline to the end of 12 weeks of either therapy. We will also examine predictors of treatment outcome including severity of executive dysfunction, baseline BDNF concentrations, and baseline CP measures. The baseline neuropsychological testing, brain imaging, and depression assessment will be obtained in a companion study (PI S. Mackin; CHR #H42689-32681-01) that is IRB approved and is already in progress. In the current study a baseline serum BDNF level will be added to Dr. Mackin's protocol. Patients will then receive either 12 weeks of Problem Solving Therapy or antidepressant treatment with sertraline. Both treatments are evidence based and commonly administered in our clinic. Outcome variables will be measures of depression severity, the BDNF serum concentration, cerebral perfusion using a MRI arterial spin labeling (ASL) technique and cognitive changes in memory and executive dysfunction. This is a preliminary or pilot study. The primary objectives are to determine if the methods appear feasible and to determine if change in BDNF or CP occur after treatment and secondarily to determine if there are changes in cognitive functioning. The study is not powered to show differences between treatments. The hypotheses are 1) PST will result in increased perfusion in frontal regions of the brain but that frontal perfusion will not change with sertraline; 2)sertraline will result in an increase in BDNF but PST will not. Change in cognitive measures of memory, learning, and executive dysfunction will be examined on an exploratory basis.

Participants will be recruited from the general patient pool of the OHSU School of Dentistry. Patients will have to qualify for the study by meeting the following criteria: age between 18 and 75 years old, ASA status I or II, are currently planning treatment for the extraction of teeth, and the patient understands and signs the consent form. The principal investigator will conduct an interview with the patient and the student-provider, and obtain informed consent from the patient.    The teeth to be extracted will be numbed with local anesthetic. The teeth will be isolated with a rubber dam and disinfected. The pulp chamber will be accessed using normal dental equipment and the root canal will be cleaned and shaped using either the ultrasonic irrigation technique or needle irrigation. This is the first step of standard root canal therapy. The tooth will then be extracted and the principal investigator will retain extracted teeth to perform further examination to see how thoroughly the root canals were cleaned. The teeth will be discarded after study.    The investigational device (Vista ultrasonic bypass system) consists of a 30 gauge slot needle which attaches to an ultrasonic unit (Satalec P5). Irrigants will be delivered to the apical 1/3 of the root canal through the needle at the same time the needle is being activated ultrasonically. Irrigant delivery will be controlled by a standard syringe pump. Conventional needle irrigation will be delivered using a 27guage slot needle placed into the root canal. Irrigants will be expressed with positive pressure at a location in the canal short of the needle binding    Once the first step of root canal therapy has been completed, the tooth will be extracted, decalcified, and tissue specimens will be taken from the bottom 3 mm. These sections will be evaluated under magnification and remaining debris in the root canal will be quantified using the NIH Image software. The data will be statistically analyzed to determine and differences between the two irrigation techniques.

Malnutrition is associated with negative consequences, including higher rates of complications, longer hospital stay, impaired wound healing and increased mortality with consequent effects on costs of healthcare. Evidence suggests that there may be benefits to some malnourished patients from receiving oral nutrition supplements in the short-term but it is not known whether these benefits can be sustained and indeed whether similar benefits may be achieved using food-based interventions of lower cost. The overall objective of the study is to compare two nutritional interventions among malnourished patients with COPD (n=200); oral nutrition supplement (ONS) vs. energy and protein dense in-between meals snack during hospitalisation and at home. Subjects will be followed for one year. The primary endpoint is weight change.

Glutathione is a small peptide made from 3 amino acids, glutamate, cysteine, and glycine.  This study is looking at how blood sugar levels may affect the way glutathione is made and used by the body. Since glutathione is continuously synthesized and broken down, the amount of glutathione present in the blood depends on the balance between its rate of synthesis and its rate of use.  In earlier studies, we found that in poorly controlled diabetic teenagers, glutathione was low, not because it was not produced fast enough, but because it was used at an excessive rate. In this study, we want to find out whether improving blood sugar control will increase glutathione levels, and, if so, how long this will take. We also hope to find out if oral supplementation with a mixture of several antioxidant vitamins and minerals will increase glutathione levels more than taking a placebo.

This state is frequently associated with chronic diseases like obesity, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and hepatic steatosis. In the liver, the oxidative stress may trigger the progression of fatty liver disease, from triglyceride accumulation to inflammation, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, the attenuation of oxidative stress, could be an important therapeutic target to lessen the severity of the disease. Until now, there is not a medical treatment to cure non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, but therapies aimed at reducing oxidative stress have been proposed. Metadoxine, an ionic complex of pyridoxine-pyrrolidone molecule, acts as a synthetic antioxidant, forming traps that can reduce free radicals; likewise, metadoxine has a proven capacity to reduce fat liver in alcoholic hepatitis. Finally, in fact that alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver diseases share molecular mechanisms in the generation of oxidative stress, the investigators propose metadoxine as a posssible modifier of the oxidative stress in non-alcoholic liver disease, prediabetic patients.

This may lead to the activation of stress-sensitive intracellular signaling pathways, causing cellular damage and late complications of diabetes including renal injury. Although the investigators understanding of how hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress ultimately leads to tissue damage has advanced considerably in recent years, effective therapeutic strategies to prevent or delay the development of this damage remain limited. The flavonoid complex silymarin, an extract from the milk thistle, and its major pharmacological active component silibinin are free radical scavengers and potent membrane stabilizers by preventing lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, during early stages of diabetes, flavonoids minimize oxidative stress, and inflammation which represent important factors in the development of diabetic nephropathy.  In this study the investigators plan to evaluate the renoprotective effect of milk thistle extract on type II diabetic patients with kidney disease.

Pharmacists are front line primary healthcare professionals who see patients with diabetes frequently and in Alberta, they have been allowed to prescribe medications and order laboratory tests. As such, pharmacists could systematically identify poorly controlled diabetes patients and provide greater access to diabetes interventions to improve blood sugar control.  Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the effect of a community pharmacist intervention on blood sugar control in individuals with poorly controlled diabetes.  Project description:  100 adults with type 2 diabetes and uncontrolled blood sugar will be defined by the participating pharmacists. Blood sugar control is going to assessed using hemoglobin A1c test (a blood test to measure individual's blood sugar control over the last 3 months). This test requires obtaining a blood spot from the patient which will be obtained by pricking his/her fingertip. Based on the hemoglobin A1c test result the pharmacist will assess the patient's need for insulin glargine, if the patient needs insulin glargine the pharmacist is going to prescribe it for him/her and educate him/her on its use. Patients are going to be followed up closely by the pharmacists for 6 months with regular updates to the patients' family physicians. This multi-centre study should demonstrate pharmacists' ability to improve glycemic control and improve access to care.

Hyperglycemia and insulin resistance or insufficiency in diabetes can cause oxidative stress by excessive reactive oxygen species and can increase damage and alter antioxidant status in nerve cells. Antioxidant defense mechanisms protect against damage or restore oxidative damage. Glutathione, a powerful antioxidant plays a key role in the first line of antioxidant defense and seems to be a sensitive indicator of oxidative stress in various diseases such as diabetes. Glutathione functions in the regeneration of vitamin C which is another crucial antioxidant. Both hyperglycemia and insulin insufficiency inhibit uptake of vitamin C. The brain contains measurable amounts of glutathione that contribute to the antioxidant pool in the brain and guards against disease processes that are caused by oxidative stress. Since the brain is the most highly oxidative organ in the body and highly susceptible to oxidative stress, with increasing impact on diabetes, biomarkers of oxidative stress in the brain through the use of novel magnetic resonance imaging techniques for glutathione and vitamin C will be studied.

Over time, proteins can be irreversibly damaged by a variety of factors, such as reactive oxygen species, and without timely degradation they can accumulate and aggregate. We believe this can contribute to the development of chronic degenerative disorders.  The purpose of this study is to develop a novel methodology for measuring protein accumulation and test it in two groups of people: young (18-30 years) and old (¡Ý65 years). This methodology will require that people drink a solution of essential amino acids that includes isotopically labeled L[ring-13C6]phenylalanine. We will then collect blood and muscle samples, to isolate plasma and skeletal muscle proteins. Participants will return to the study center four more times on a weekly interval.  We hypothesize that older proteins, which persisted in circulation and accumulated over time, will have a higher degree of post-translational oxidative damage than newly synthesized proteins.

An "anterior wall prolapse" occurs when the front of the vagina loses its support, and the bladder drops down and rotates into the vaginal opening. The bladder can cause a bulge out of the vagina.  One of the treatment options available is to repair the anterior wall surgically. The goals of surgery are to return the anatomy to its usual position, ensuring that all the pelvic floor organs (bladder, vagina and rectum) can function properly. The ideal surgical repair would also be long lasting.  Two surgical options are routinely performed in Calgary for repair of an anterior compartment prolapse. One option involves fixing the organs back in place using sutures. The other option uses sutures plus a mesh made of small intestine submucosa (SIS) that is already licensed for use in Canada. The SIS mesh is slowly absorbed after it is placed in the pelvic area. The investigators do not know which of these two options is the best surgical procedure. Both may have different advantages that would result in better results. This study is designed to try and find out if one of these procedures is better, and if a larger study may be needed.

ROS	Terminated	Randomized Controlled Trial of Vaginal Progesterone in Women With Threatened Preterm Labor	Obstetric Labor, Premature	Drug: Vaginal progesterone;   Drug: Placebo	                Phase 4              	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01286246?term=ROS&rank=604	NCT01286246	Prematurity remains the most important single factor in perinatal morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, the rate of premature delivery is increasing in Canada and is especially high in Alberta with 7.5% of pregnancies ending before 37 weeks gestation. Despite years of research into the causes of spontaneous preterm labor, few effective treatments have been identified. Progesterone is one candidate treatment. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether progesterone can prolong pregnancy in women who have symptoms of preterm labor.  Pregnant women who have symptoms of premature labor will be invited to take part in the study if they are between 22 to 24 weeks pregnant. If they agree to join the study, they will be randomly allocated to either take progesterone 200mg each day via the vagina until 36 weeks, or to take a placebo preparation. Neither the women nor their clinician will know which group they are in.  Women and their babies will be followed until 28 days after the birth, to find out about the length of the pregnancy, any adverse events that might occur (none have been reported in previous trials), and to look at whether women have taken the treatment.  When the study is complete, the results for the progesterone group will be compared to the placebo group. If progesterone is found to be useful in helping to prolong pregnancy, then this will be a possible treatment to help mothers in the future.

The highest concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin are found in the fovea. Since light entering the eye passes through the MP before reaching the photo receptors it absorbs a significant portion of short-wavelength light. There is evidence that this absorbing properties of the MP as well as the ability of inactivating highly reactive oxygen species are protective for the retina.  Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness among developed countries. The pathogenesis of this disease remains unknown. There is, however, evidence that low fruit and vegetable consumption increases the risk of Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Accordingly, it has been hypothesized that lutein supplementation may be beneficial in AMD. The present study investigates whether 6 months lutein supplementation increases MP optical density (OD), influences visual acuity, depth and dimension of central scotoma and alters symptoms in patients with AMD.

Some patients taking anti-HIV drugs develop hyperlactatemia. Hyperlactatemia is a condition in which lactate (a natural substance normally present in the body) levels are too high. Too much lactate in the body can lead to serious health problems. When patients suffer from hyperlactatemia while taking anti-HIV drugs, most doctors temporarily stop the drugs. Patients then restart the anti-HIV drugs when their lactate levels return to normal. If patients restart the same drugs they were taking when they developed hyperlactatemia, there is a risk that they may develop high lactate levels again. This study wants to find out if taking antioxidants (substances that reduce tissue damage due to oxygen radicals) and certain B vitamins may help prevent patients from developing hyperlactatemia when they restart the same anti-HIV drugs.

Pioglitazone a thiazolidinedione, is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved oral anti-diabetic agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Though there are many benefits for using thiazolidinediones in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, there is data that indicates that rosiglitazone therapy results in a significant decrease in total body bone mineral density in mice. Whether it is true in humans is not clear. If the animal data can be extrapolated to humans, thiazolidinediones may pose a significant risk of adverse effects on bone. This study hypothesizes that treatment with the thiazolidinedione pioglitazone may result in significant reduction in bone mineral density. The aims of this are: 1. to evaluate the effect of pioglitazone on skeletal health; 2. to measure the bone mineral density (BMD) of the spine and hip, as well as bone turnover markers, at different times of persons taking thiazolidinediones and others not taking them; 3. to determine the change in BMD and bone turnover markers within different groups at different times; and 4. to compare these changes.

The prevalence of sarcopenia is high, with ¡Ý 45% of the U.S. population aged 60 years or older sarcopenic. Some possible causative factors include a decline in muscle protein synthesis, inactivity, hormonal changes, pro-inflammatory conditions, and reactive oxygen species within the muscle mitochondria, which may all be exacerbated by inadequate nutritional intake. Since dietary protein is targeted to muscle and muscle mass represents the largest tissue in the body, protein nutrition plays a significant role in muscle metabolism.  SPECIFIC AIMS The specific aim of this proposed study is to determine the effect of PS-IPC supplementation on muscle mass, muscle strength, muscle quality, and inflammatory / immune markers in healthy older adults. Subjects scoring 4 - 10 on the Short-Physical Performance Battery and aged 60-85 years will consume PS-IPC supplements or placebo three times daily for 12 weeks.  HYPOTHESES      Subjects consuming PS-IPC will have a greater increase in muscle mass and muscle strength compared to a control group consuming a placebo supplement.    Subjects consuming PS-IPC will demonstrate a greater increase in the fractional rate of muscle protein synthesis compared with a placebo control group.    Subjects receiving PS-IPC will have a reduction in plasma concentrations of various inflammatory markers of immune function, compared to subjects consuming the placebo.

Chronic HCV can cause progressive liver damage leading to inflammation, scarring and, in some cases, cirrhosis or liver cancer. It has been shown that fat accumulation in the liver can accelerate the disease progression and is therefore a risk factor in HCV patients.  However, the exact mechanism(s) by which fat accumulation in the liver is involved in disease progression are not clear yet. It is possible that the presence of fat provides a liver susceptible to a second injurious process which leads to scarring. Candidates for this second "hit" may include insulin resistance, leading to accumulation of fat within the liver cells and secondly oxidation of these lipids. In turn, lipid peroxidation can lead to production of reactive oxygen species (unstable molecules that can damage cells) and cytokines (signal molecules that promote inflammation) resulting in more oxidative stress and liver damage.  Aim of the study is to find out, whether patients with HCV and fatty liver have increased oxidative stress and inflammation than patients with HCV without fatty liver, and whether this is associated with a different nutritional status.

These cells accumulate more photosensitiser than normal cells. The photosensitiser generates reactive oxygen species upon illumination.  For skin diseases, there has been an increasing interest in using precursors of the endogenous photosensitiser protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). The most commonly used precursors have been 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and its derivatives. The present test drug, Metvix , contains the methyl ester of ALA, which penetrates the lesions well and shows high lesion selectivity .  In vitro studies of animal and human tissues have shown significant intracellular formation of photoactive porphyrins after addition of Metvix . The increased levels of photoactive porphyrins induced cytotoxic effects in tumour cells after photoactivation.  The primary objective is to compare PDT with Metvix  cream to PDT with placebo cream in terms of patient complete response rates based on histologically verified disappearance of the lesions at 6 months after last treatment cycle.  Secondary objectives are to compare the two treatments in terms of histological and clinical mean patient response weighted by the number of lesions within a patient, lesion response rates across patients, clinical complete patient response, cosmetic outcome and adverse events.

This is due to the effect of different autocrine and paracrine factors secreted by the embryos. Besides, previous studies with embryos from human and other mammals have shown that a high oxygen concentration may have a negative effect on embryo quality due to the generation of reactive oxygen species, which cause oxidative stress. The embryo culture at low oxygen tension is correlated to better success rates in IVF/ICSI treatments.  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the combined effect of the embryo group culture and the low oxygen tension on the embryo development and the results of the IVF/ICSI treatments. The specific goal is to compare the embryo group culture in a reduced volume of medium at a low oxygen tension (5%) with the standard individual culture at an atmospheric oxygen tension (20%). The first culture condition will be applied in a K-MINC incubator (COOK Medical ), whereas the second condition will be applied using a Heracell incubator (Heraeus ).

Such changes have been considered particularly relevant in the bleeding complications that occur in cirrhosis.  However, several studies have shown that routine diagnostic tests are not clinically useful to stratify bleeding risk in patients with cirrhosis. Moreover, treatments used to increase platelet count or to modulate platelet function could potentially do harm. Consequently the optimal management of bleeding complications is still a matter of discussion.  Moreover, in the last two decades there has been an increased recognition that not only bleeding but also thrombosis complicates the clinical course of cirrhosis. Over the last years, emerge that in vivo platelet function and coagulation cascade might be modulated by an alteration of pro-oxidant and antioxidant balance. Thus It has previously been demonstrated that chronic liver diseases are characterized by increased oxidative stress state.  Aim of the study is to analyse the relationship between oxidative stress, haemostatic balance and clinical complications in cirrhosis.

ROS	Completed	A Comparison of White-light and Daylight Topical Methyl 5-aminolaevulinic Acid Photodynamic Therapy for Actinic Keratoses	Actinic Keratoses	Device: Daylight and Maquet Power 500 LED surgery light		https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02520700?term=ROS&rank=650	NCT02520700	Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses visible light to treat a premalignant condition, called actinic keratosis, which results on chronically sun exposed skin such as on a balding scalp. A cream is applied containing aminolaevulinic acid or methyl aminolaevulinate and this is converted in the cells to the photodegradable product protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). Visible light causes the degradation of PpIX resulting in the production of reactive oxygen species and then cell death in the actinic keratosis. In conventional PDT a lamp is used to supply the visible light. The main draw back to treatment is pain. Recent studies have shown that daylight can be used as the source of visible light and is as effective as conventional PDT. Patients find this form of treatment less painful and therefore preferable. The reduction in pain seen in daylight PDT appears to be related to the fact that no significant quantity of PpIX accumulates prior to exposure to the light source and small quantities of PpIX are activated continuously during daylight exposure. The drawback of performing daylight PDT in Ireland is the climate, both in terms of cloud cover and temperature. The typical daylight treatment times is 2 hours and it would be difficult for patients to stay outside in winter, spring and autumn. This study investigates the use of an artificial white light source, a Maquet PWD 50SF theatre-light, as an alternative.	[]	[]

They display marked abnormalities in phenotype and function in various autoimmune diseases, including systemic vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  These neutrophils are characterised by an extended life span, increased capacity to produce reactive oxygen species, active gene expression and release of extracellular traps. Consequently, there is a need for better understanding of neutrophil phenotype and functions in these conditions, as well as for identifying molecules capable of specifically manipulating neutrophil function. The investigators have recently discovered that interferon lambdas (IFN-¦Ës), also known as interleukin 28 (IL28) and interleukin 29 (IL29), class II cytokines with previously studied anti-viral biological functions, specifically suppress neutrophil infiltration and interleukin-1¦Â production and thereby, halt and reverse the development of collagen induced arthritis (CIA). The investigators propose to further investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind this suppression and examine the translational potential of the investigators' finding by examining the IFN-¦Ë receptor expression and function in neutrophils isolated from the blood of healthy donors and rheumatic patients (early rheumatoid arthritis and vasculitis).

Inflammation, hypoxia-ischemia, free oxygen radical formation and excitotoxicity are all known pathogenic mechanisms that mediate this injury. Erythropoietin (EPO) has been shown to be protective against hypoxic-ischemic and inflammatory injuries. During the past decade, recombinant human Epo (rhEpo) has been widely used in preterm infants to prevent or treat the anemia of prematurity, in general, rhEpo has been considered to be safe and well tolerated in preterm infants. EPO was considered not capable of passing through blood-brain-barrier at low dose. Evidence from animal experiments reveals that rhEpo must be given in high doses at the beginning or within a short (up to 6 hours), critical time period after the onset of brain injury to achieve a significant neuroprotective effect. A recent study using high-dose rhEpo (3000 U rhEpo/kg body weight at birth) for neuroprotection in very preterm infants revealed that no signs of adverse effects of early high-dose rhEpo treatment in very preterm infants were identified. Contrary to this, a recent study in PVL of a rat model revealed that using a low dose rhEpo (50-100 U/kg) was effective in the treatment of brain damage induced by hypoxia-ischemia and did not affect normal oligodendrocyte maturity. On this basis, the researchers intent to investigate (1) whether low-dose rhEpo (100 U/kg) or high-dose rhEpo (3,000 U/kg) given to very preterm infants (gestation age < 32 weeks) immediately after birth and subsequently during the first 2 days is safe and possesses neuroprotective properties;(2) whether there are gender differences in response to the hypoxia-ischemic insult and EPO treatment; (3)the pharmacokinetics of low dose and high dose rhEPO. Very preterm infants with gestational age of < 32 weeks and admitted to the NICU are eligible for enrollment.

A large number of synthetic and natural antioxidants are known to induce beneficial effects on human health and disease prevention. Cardioprotective ability of grape seed extract polyphenols (GSEP) was studied in animals and humans. It has been suggested that grape seed proanthocyanidins have cardioprotective effects against reperfusion-induced injury of free radicals after ischemia. In another study, it is suggested that proanthocyanidins, the major polyphenols in red wine, might trap reactive oxygen species in aqueous series such as plasma and interstitial fluid of the arterial wall; thereby inhibiting oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and showing an antiatherosclerotic activity. The only human model study designed to evaluate the effect of a standardized formulation of a GSEP (leucoselect-phytosome [LP]) on the susceptibility of LDL to oxidation in a group of heavy smokers, revealed that the antioxidant potential of GSEP may be effective in oxidative stress (smoking); however more investigational data are needed before wider use in clinical settings. Based on these observations, the investigators decided to evaluate the effect of GSEP in reducing OX-LDL in patients diagnosed with mild hyperlipidemia.

When Doppler ultrasound studies of the umbilical artery are abnormal pathological intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) can be diagnosed. IUGR fetuses have a higher mortality and morbidity, both perinatally and on the longer term. This is probably due to chronic malnourishment and hypoxia due to placental insufficiency. This placental dysfunction causes generation of harmful free oxygen radicals in the fetus. The IUGR fetus has a diminished antioxidative capacity which means these free radicals cannot be buffered sufficiently. This leads to fetal oxidative stress.  Previous studies have shown that allopurinol can inhibit the cascades that lead to generation of free radicals. High dosed allopurinol also scavenges radicals and binds free iron without adverse effects on the fetus or mother.  As IUGR is associated with placental insufficiency and excessive production of free radicals we hypothesize that antenatal allopurinol administration could lead to a decrease in oxidative stress in the mother and fetus and subsequent improvement of the maternal and/or neonatal outcome.

Their role in sepsis has been long established as the primary phagocyte to clear the infectious process. In the early phase of sepsis, one observes a massive recruitment of immature neutrophils from the bone marrow into peripheral blood, the so-called "band forms" or "left shift cells". Despite the daily clinical use of neutrophil band forms count in the care of septic patients and their abundance in septic blood, no information exists on the fate of these cells, nor on their capacity to mount an efficient innate immune response. It is the goal of this proposal to study the fate and the innate immune functions of immature neutrophils obtained in patients with early septic shock. Immature neutrophils will be separated from mature neutrophils. The following functions will be studied ex vivo in mature vs. immature neutrophils from a series of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock: (1) surface expression of receptors of the innate immunity; (2) production of inflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen species in response to bacterial agonists; (3) chemotaxis; (4) phagocytosis of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria; and (5) ex vivo viability (life span) and resistance to apoptosis. Importantly, the investigators have developed and mastered all in vitro assays and cell separation techniques necessary to address and answer these important questions. This project will undoubtedly shed light on the fate and function of a prominent leukocyte population circulating in patients with severe bacterial infections and sepsis.

The pathogenesis of perioperative myocardial infarction is complex and to date not fully elucidated. The physiological stress response associated with the surgical procedure is believed to be central in the development of perioperative cardiovascular complications. Surgery initiates systemic inflammation, hypercoagulability and increases the production of catecholamines and cortisol. These drastic systemic changes lead to a state of myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch, which added to acute endothelial dysfunction and ruptures of vulnerable plaques, may result in myocardial injury.  The endothelium is a regulator of vascular homeostasis, vascular tone and structure and exerts anticoagulant, antiplatelet and fibrinolytic properties. Endothelial dysfunction is characterized by a decreased vascular bioavailability of nitric oxide probably due to an increased degradation of nitric oxide via its interaction with locally produced reactive oxygen species. No clinical studies have investigated whether peri- and postoperative endothelial dysfunction is associated with an increased risk of perioperative myocardial injury. Endothelial dysfunction may be a key element in the development of perioperative myocardial injury.  The aim of this observational clinical study is to closely examine the endothelial function and its dynamics in the early postoperative period.

The abnormalities observed are both quantitative and functional, and concern several components of the immune response. Flavonoids are phenolic compounds widely distributed in plants, which were reported to exert multiple biological effects, including antioxidant and free radical scavenging abilities. Silymarin, a flavonolignan complex isolated from milk thistle (Silybum marianum L. Gaertn), have been classified as cytoprotective, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and especially as hepatoprotective agents. Silymarin is already being used clinically for treatment of liver diseases.It is considered safe and well-tolerated, with reported adverse events similar to placebo. Several studies have also reported immunomodulatory actions of silymarin. It increases lymphocyte proliferation, interferon gamma, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 secretions by stimulated lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner. It has been shown that in vitro treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with silymarin causes restoration of the thiol status and increases in T cell proliferation and activation. Because reactive oxygen species and iron overload play important roles in the pathophysiology of thalassemia, silymarin may be an effective therapy due to its antioxidant, immunomodulatory, cytoprotective and iron chelating activities.

However, as documented by the current discussion about the potential benefits of glitazones, high hopes can fail. Initial beneficial cardiovascular effects shown in proof-of-concept studies were muted by the apparent higher mortality in the metaanalysis of studies with rosiglitazone. The rapidly increasing use of GLP-1 analogues and DPP-4 (Dipeptidyl protease 4) inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus may be of major interest for the cardiologist. Potential beneficial actions on the cardiovascular system so far shown in animal experiments and small proof of concept studies may provide the rationale for using these drugs specifically in diabetic patients with secondary complications such as macrovascular disease or diabetic cardiomyopathy. Theoretically, these new therapies could also proof beneficial in patients with heart failure, independently of concomitant diabetes mellitus. However, many unanswered questions need to be addressed in the near future to extend the experimental findings to potential benefits of real life patients. In summary a new class of antidiabetic drugs, which could possibly directly influence cardiovascular effects of diabetes mellitus and thus possibly treat or even prevent life threatening complications has become available.  Then our working hypothesis was that incretins may have desirable cardiovascular outcomes through modulating platelet function. In order to test this hypothesis we propose to assess the presence of their specific receptors in isolated human platelets. In addition, we proposed to sudy the effect of the endogenous incretins (glucagon-like peptide 1 and gastric inhibitory peptide) on human platelet function isolated in a test tube.

The interaction of these compounds with their receptor, the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) triggers several signalling pathways which will lead to increase in inflammatory molecules and enhanced reactive oxygen species. In addition, to the membrane receptor RAGE, there are two soluble forms, the soluble RAGE (sRAGE) and the endogenous secretory RAGE (esRAGE), these soluble receptors are capable to bind AGEs and block the AGE-RAGE axis. It has been observed that in diabetes the needs of thiamine are increased, and it could be an inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway (thiamine is an essential cofactor in this pathway) and activation of other metabolic pathways among them AGEs formation. It has been proposed that supplementation of benfotiamine could decreased the risk of micro and macrovascular complications, and this could be in part because a decreased in the formation of AGEs. For this reason, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of benfotiamine on AGEs and its soluble receptors (sRAGE) in patients with type 2 diabetes.  The specific objectives in the current study are:      To evaluate and compare clinical and anthropometric characteristics in type 2 DM patients with and without benfotiamine treatment.    To evaluate and compare in type 2 DM patients with and without benfotiamine treatment the following biochemical parameters: total AGEs, Carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), sRAGE, glucose, hemoglobin A1c, lipids (total cholesterol, C-HDL, C-LDL, and triglycerides).    To evaluate and compare dietary data such as dietary AGEs and macro and macronutrients in type 2 DM patients with and without benfotiamine treatment.

You must be diagnosed to have relapsed/refractory leukemia or lymphoma (blood cancer) and have tried other standard therapies.  This study is designed to determine whether ZIO-101 may be given safely. The study will also test whether ZIO-101 helps to treat blood cancer.  We anticipate that approximately 22 to 35 patients will take part in this study.  Arsenic has been used as a medicinal agent for centuries in many different cultures. Most recently in the United States, an inorganic arsenic compound was approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). However, use of inorganic arsenic is limited by a narrow range of activity and systemic toxicity, most notably of the cardiac system.  ZIO-101 is an organic arsenic derivative. In vitro testing in both the National Cancer Institute (NCI) cancer cell panel and in vivo testing in a leukemia animal model demonstrated substantial activity of SGLU against hematologic cancers. In vitro testing of SGLU using the NCI human cancer cell panel also detected activity against lung, colon and brain cancers, melanoma, and ovary and kidney cancers. Moderate activity was seen against breast and prostate cancers cells. Data suggest that organic arsenic generates reactive oxygen species in the cells to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.

ROS	Completed	PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN THE TREATMENT OF OBESITY	Obesity	Behavioral: diet-plus-continuous bouts of vigorous aerobic exercise;   Behavioral: diet plus shorts bouts;   Behavioral: diet plus lifestyle activity	JHU School of Med	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00615238?term=ROS&rank=630	NCT00615238	Although exercise is widely regarded as a key component in obesity treatment, few individuals seem able to adhere to exercise programs over time. In response, efforts have focused on developing new approaches to physical activity that may appeal to sedentary overweight persons. For instance, is has been shown that accumulating multiple short bouts of vigorous exercise may enhance both exercise adherence and weight loss in overweight persons. Accumulating moderate-intensity activity throughout the day may offer comparable health and weight benefits as a traditional exercise program. Public health recommendations now include the option of accumulating 30 minutes of moderate-intensity lifestyle activity for health and well-being. While these two options offer a viable alternative to those who dislike or cannot sustain continuous vigorous exercise programs, it is unclear whether the flexibility of accumulating physical activity or the vigorous intensity of the exercise is responsible for improved weight loss and long-term adherence.  The goal of this research is to extend our preliminary findings suggesting that moderate intensity lifestyle activity is an important and viable alternative to traditional structured vigorous exercise for obese dieting individuals. The primary specific aim of this project is to compare the effects of three modes of exercise on long-term weight regain. Participants will be 165 overweight men and women who are sedentary, but otherwise healthy. All participants will receive the same 16-week behavioral weight loss program and will be randomized to one of three exercise study conditions: 1) diet-plus-continuous bouts of vigorous aerobic exercise; 2) diet-plus-short bouts of vigorous aerobic exercise accumulated throughout the day; or 3) diet-plus-moderate intensity lifestyle activity accumulated throughout the day. By varying both the intensity and duration of exercise bouts, we can determine which type of exercise is associated with optimal outcomes one year later. Additional questions of interest include:      Does mode of exercise influence exercise adherence     Does mode of exercise improve cardiovascular risk profiles similarly in all three conditions     Does mode of exercise influence changes in body composition     Does mode of exercise influence exercise enjoyment and exercise self-efficacy   	United States, Maryland || Johns Hopkins School of Medicine || Baltimore, Maryland, United States, 21224	[]	Physical Activity in the Treatment of Obesity: A Randomized Trial

ROS	Recruiting	Fat Metabolism in OSA and COPD	Obstructive Sleep Apnea;   Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease;   Obesity		dk.walker@tamu.edu	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02157844?term=ROS&rank=700	NCT02157844	Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common type of sleep apnea and is caused by an obstruction of the upper airways. The obstruction results in periods of intermittent hypoxia and re-oxygenation, which lead to increased oxidative stress, increased inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and insulin resistance. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease that leads to poor airflow. This disease leads to systemic hypoxia, reduced oxidative capacity, and increased inflammation. The direct cause of OSA and COPD is unclear, but OSA and COPD may be linked to other comorbid conditions such as obesity and type II diabetes. Upon onset of OSA and COPD, metabolic disturbances associated with obesity and type II diabetes can be exacerbated.  Obesity is a condition characterized by an increase in visceral fat, elevated plasma levels of free fatty acids, inflammation, and insulin resistance. Although the effects of body fat distribution have not been studied in these patients, an increase in both subcutaneous and abdominal fat mass in non-OSA older women was shown to increase morbidity and mortality. Fat/adipose tissue is an active tissue capable of secreting proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6, reactive oxygen species and adipokines. Particularly, abdominal fat is a prominent source of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which contributes to a low grade, chronic inflammatory state in these patients. Additionally, an increased inflammatory state is associated with reduced lean body mass, and together with elevated circulating free fatty acids may increase the occurrence of lipotoxicity and insulin resistance. Thus, increased fat deposition is associated with a poor prognosis in OSA and COPD patients and therefore it is of clinical and scientific importance to understand the changes in fat metabolism and digestion as a result of OSA and COPD.  It is therefore our hypothesis that fat synthesis and insulin resistance is increased and whole body protein synthesis is decreased in OSA and COPD patients, leading to a poor prognosis.

Measuring only oxygen saturation levels with pulse oximetry may be inadequate. End tidal carbon dioxide levels or arterial blood gases should be measured periodically, depending on the clinical condition of the patient. A thorough review of systems will help define any problems. Patients who are hypoventilating often have elevated carbon dioxide levels at night and complain of a morning headache, restlessness or nightmares, and poor quality sleep. This may cause daytime sleepiness. Insufficient respiration with hypoxia may occur later, especially if the lung is damaged by chronic aspiration.  We propose to evaluate the use of the Nonin LifeSense monitor in home evaluation of respiration, oxygen level, heart rate, and carbon dioxide level and to develop interpretation of the results that will lead to appropriate interventions for apnea, and insufficient respiration.  Relevance to MDA Fewer than one per cent of the Muscular Dystrophy Association have pulmonologists as co-directors.Late referral of progressive restrictive lung disease leads to invasive support of respiratory failure. Early initiation of non invasive ventilation techniques requires patience on the part of the caregiver and exploration of mask interfaces and ventilation techniques. In addition, the development of new therapies, currently manifested through enhanced diagnostic accuracy, will require new signal for initiation and in the assessment of success or failure.  Aims Aim 1. To assess the utility of a small portable device (LifeSense Monitor Nonin Medical Inc. Plymouth Minnesota) with extended recording capabilty to provide accurate diagnosis of hypoventilation.  Aim 2. To provide an easily interpretable report defining sleep hypoxemia, hypercapnea, and apnea.  Aim 3. To promote early evaluation and treatment of the respiratory problems in centers that do not have pumonologists as these are essential to prognosis, whether of survival or of quality of life, in neuromuscular diseases.

ROS	Completed	Study of UK Adults With Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia.	Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia			https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00749593?term=ROS&rank=699	NCT00749593	Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) is one of the commonest inherited diseases, affecting 1:14,200 live births. It is the result of a genetic defect in one of the enzymes (in most cases 21-hydroxylase) required for cortisol biosynthesis, leading to reduced levels of cortisol and aldosterone, increased ACTH concentrations and consequently increased adrenal androgen production. Patients suffer from problems with growth and development and as adults patients may have problems with fertility, virilisation in women, testicular masses in men and both men and women have an impaired quality of life. Patients have to take life-long therapy. Despite its frequency knowledge surrounding the management of adults with CAH remains fairly limited. There has been a lot of work describing the management of children with CAH but to date there is no consensus on how to manage adults. To address this issue a number of adult endocrinologists in the UK under the auspices of the Society for Endocrinology have established a country wide study (CaHASE) to undertake research in order to set standards of care for adult patients with CAH.  In CAH the severity of the symptoms experienced by affected individuals varies depending on the mutation and the genetic background of the individual. The ability to tailor CAH therapy on an individual basis, as determined by the severity of the underlying defect and an understanding of the likely natural history of the disease, is a key goal in clinical management. Correlation of phenotype (clinical status) and genotype (the underlying 21 hydroxylase gene mutation) will facilitate stratification of severity and provide an important contribution to the debate on potential mechanisms of individualised therapy. For instance it may become clear that certain CAH genotypes are associated with specific long term outcomes. In time, this could lead to suggesting different treatment strategies in certain groups. Moreover, genotype data are important if we are to address the relative contribution of environment (e.g. treatment) vs. genetics on long term outcomes.  This multi-centre study aims to:      - Investigate the medical health of adults with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.    - Investigate the relationship between the genotype of the patient and the phenotype.    - Investigate the quality of life of adults with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

The aim is to perform a randomized, controlled, phase III/IV study comparing enteric-coated mycophenolate (ECMs) with azathioprine for induction and maintenance therapy of the non-renal manifestations of SLE. Methods: Patients with non-renal SLE flares (SLEDAI¡Ý6 and/or BILAG o 2B refractory to full doses of hydroxychloroquine and prednisolone (¡Ý10 mg/d) or with relapsing flares will be included. Patients will be stratified according the flare severity (moderate (SLEDAI<12)-severe (SLEDAI¡Ý12)) and randomized (1:1) into two groups of treatment, EMCs (2gr/d) or AZA (2-2.5mg/kg/d) according to TMPT levels for 6 months. Dose will be progressively tapered based on clinical response up to completing a year of treatment. The main aim is the percentage of complete remission achieved ((SLEDAI <4 and/or absence of any BILAG A o B) at week 12 and 24 for moderate and severe flares, respectively. Secondary objectives include evaluating the reduction in the steroid requirement, number of flares post-treatment, effect on the biological parameters, and impact on quality of life, damage and drug safety. To detect a 20% difference between the two drugs with a 80% statistical power (0.05 alpha error), considering a follow up loss of 20%, a total of 240 patients is required.

The overall Goal of this randomized controlled clinical trial is to examine the synergistic effect of a multifactor risk reduction on walking distance, blood flow and quality of life in 300 patients with PAD.  Specifically, we will compare the effects of 24 months of a novel, yet well-tested multiple risk factor reduction program, the Health Education and Risk Reduction Training (HEAR2T) Program for PAD versus enhanced standard care on: 1) symptom limited walking distance as assessed by treadmill exercise testing and walking impairment questionnaire; 2) endothelial function as measured by flow mediated vasodilation (FMVD) via brachial artery ultrasound. We will also explore the association between FMVD and decreased oxidative stress (as measured by oxygen radical absorbance capacity and urinary isoprostanes) and reduced degradation of nitric oxide (NO) and/or increased NO biosynthesis (as measured by urine nitrogen oxide, plasma nitrogen oxide, plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine, plasma, urine and platelet cyclic GMP).  Secondary hypotheses examine the association between reducing CVD risk factors, improved endothelial function, increased walking distance, improved quality of life and number of metabolic syndrome abnormalities in PAD patients.  Significance. This study will contribute to evidence on the efficacy of multiple risk factor reduction on improving physical function and quality of life in the understudied, elderly PAD patient. This study will also provide preliminary evidence for the biological basis for the efficacy of multifactor risk reduction in restoring vascular homeostasis, critical because of its role in antiatherogenesis and maintaining vasoreactivity, both necessary for slowing the progression of atherosclerosis.

This study proposes to examine these responses in periodontitis patients and healthy controls.  The proposed study will include patients undergoing periodontal (gum) treatment who will be matched to periodontally healthy controls. Blood, gingival crevicular (gum) fluid and clinical measures will be collected both pre- and post-therapy to measure differences in cell behaviour both before, and following routine therapy.  Blood samples will be used to isolate peripheral blood neutrophils prior to analysis of their responses to different bacterial stimuli including oxygen radical, cytokine and extracellular trap release. Gingival Crevicular Fluid samples will be used to measure different biochemical markers that result from the production of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs). Routine clinical measures will be taken both pre- and post-therapy as a measure of treatment response.  Patient volunteers undergoing treatment will be asked to donate a total of four small samples of tissue from the gums whilst they are already anaesthetised for routine treatment. These will be approximately the size of a needle head (2mm2mm) and used to examine NET formation within the tissues and related processes. This will provide novel in-vivo data regarding this recently discovered method of neutrophil defence in innate immunity.  This proposal represents a novel study aimed at improving our current understanding of why inflammatory periodontitis develops in some patients but not others, as well as providing pointers to causal/noncausal relationships between periodontitis and important systemic conditions such as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.  Ultimately, novel treatment approaches and primary prevention (for periodontitis) or secondary prevention (for systemic disease) strategies may emerge.

High-fat meal consumption induces postprandial vascular endothelial dysfunction and other cardiometabolic disturbances (e.g. dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia) in normal weight individuals and is exacerbated in overweight/obese individuals. These postprandial responses are likely largely due to activation of pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant pathways. Given that much of the day is spent in the postprandial state, this may further impair cardiovascular health in aging overweight/obese individuals. Interventions that attenuate these responses are needed. Red beetroot (Beta vulgaris L.) is an excellent source of bioactive compounds including nitrate, flavonoids, phenolic acids, betalains, carotenoids, and ascorbic acid. These bioactive compounds and their metabolites have been shown to have antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and cardiovascular-protective effects. These effects, particularly the cardiovascular-protective effects, have been primarily attributed to its high content of nitrate since it is converted to nitric oxide independent of the vascular endothelium via the enterosalivary nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway. However, red beetroot juice contains a number of other potentially beneficial bioactive compounds and few studies have aimed to determine whether these compounds work independently, additively, or synergistically in exerting these effects. Given the findings of previously conducted research in the broad area of red beetroot juice consumption and human health, it can be suggested that: 1) acute red beetroot juice consumption may prevent or attenuate the adverse postprandial responses to consuming a high-fat meal in individuals with exaggerated responses; and 2) chronic consumption of red beetroot may improve underlying factors contributing to these exaggerated responses. Accordingly, this project aims to: 1) investigate the efficacy of acute and chronic whole red beetroot juice consumption compared with its bioactive components in attenuating postprandial vascular endothelial dysfunction and adverse cardiometabolic responses to a high-fat meal; and 2) to gain insight into the underlying mechanisms responsible.

Even if the principal mechanism of action of statins is to lower cholesterol, other effects, the so-called pleiotropic effects, have been considered as adjunctive properties potentially accounting for the anti-atherosclerotic effect of statins.  Inhibition of oxidative stress may be considered an intriguing pleiotropic effect in view of the fact that oxidative stress is thought to be a key event in the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic disease. Reduction of several markers of oxidative stress including isoprostanes, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and nitrotyrosine have been observed after statin treatment. NADPH oxidase is among the most important sources of reactive oxygen species involved in atherosclerotic disease. The investigators developed an ELISA to evaluate serum levels of soluble-gp91phox, the catalytic core of phagocyte NADPH oxidase. Recently the investigators showed that statins (30 days treatment) exert an antioxidant effect via inhibition of soluble gp91phox expression.  The exact mechanism by which atorvastatin reduces NADPH oxidase, however, is unclear. Recent study showed that statin treatment inhibits leukocyte ROCK activity, a protein kinase implicated in the activation of NADPH oxidase, with a mechanism that seems to be independent from lowering cholesterol. To further study the mechanism(s) implicate in gp91phox downregulation by statin the investigators planned the present study in patients with high risk of vascular events such as hypercholesterolemic and Type 2 Diabetes mellitus patients.  In addition the investigators want to evaluate the synergistic role of atorvastatin with aspirin treatment.

It is associated with an increased duration of mechanical ventilation, high death rates and increased healthcare costs in China. However, VAP is preventable and many practices have been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of this disease, but the morbidity is still so high. So much more methods of prevention should be needed to reduce the incidence of VAP.  Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) present anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects besides their ability to regulate cholesterol composition. So it is hypothesized that early use of statin may prevent some of the infection disease such as VAP.  Actually, Two studies have showed that statin treatment is associated with reduced risk of pneumonia. However, the relationship between statins and reduced risk of pneumonia is not consistent.  After reviewing some of the guidelines,meta analyses and system reviews, the investigator find that advanced age,immune suppression from disease or medication and specially depressed level of consciousness are the risk factors of VAP. So the investigator assumes that early use of statin may give us a favorable outcome in the patients with coma or in the patients with severe disease (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score > 15 or Glasgow coma score < 7).  In addition there is no prospective study to investigate the role of statins in VAP in the patients with ischemic stroke. The investigator hopes that this study can approve the relationship between statins and reduced risk of VAP in the patients with ischemic stroke. And it can improve the processes,outcomes and costs of critical care as well.

Many risk factor for BOS were identified in previous studies such as acute cellular rejection, lymphocytic bronchiolitis, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and non-CMV respiratory infections, injury to the allograft or airways, Primary graft dysfunction, HLA mismatching, and organizing pneumonia. (Belperio JA. et al.). Neutrophils and their released products may be involved in the development of BOS. Neutrophilia was repeatedly observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients after lung transplantation. In addition, infiltration of neutrophils into the bronchial epithelium has been detected in patients with higher degrees of active airway damage. Neutrophils are capable of causing severe damage to the lung tissue by releasing toxic proteases and reactive oxygen species if not counterbalanced by the antiprotease/ antioxidant screen of the lung. Based on this background, a causal relationship between neutrophilia and the development of BOS has been proposed. (Hirsch J. et al.) Detection of unopposed Neutrophile elastase (NE) activity in BAL appears to correlate with poor outcome due to refractory BOS. Unopposed NE in these subjects may not only serve as a marker of evolving graft dysfunction but also participate in damaging the airways of the allograft and inhibit adequate bacterial clearance. Prevention of neutrophil sequestration or inhibition of NE may prevent or attenuate airway damage and improve bacterial clearance mechanisms. (Nutley D et al.) These data demonstrate the importance of neutrophils and unopposed NE in the pathogenesis of BOS and call for new approach to prevent or modulate BOS targeting this mechanism.  AAT is the main inhibitor of neutrophil elastase in the lower airways and patients with AAT deficiency have low concentrations of the protein in this region of the lung. This explains the proteinase/antiproteinase theory of the development of emphysema in deficient patients in which the amount of elastase released in the lung exceeds the amount of AAT. The net result is persistence of elastase activity leading to lung destruction and the pathological changes of emphysema. (Abusriwil H. et al.) The administration of the AAT is to address proteinase/antiproteinase imbalance.  Administration of AAT will help to prevent further destruction of the lung architecture and reduce the inflammatory dysregulation that causes pulmonary dysfunction. It is expected that by attacking a specific and previously untreated key component part of the pathophysiological cycle of BOS, AAT therapy would decrease the prevalence of BOS in lung transplant recipients and prolong life expectancy of these patients.

Understanding its pathophysiology is important for the development of future therapeutic interventions. Emerging evidence suggests interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction and the development of insulin resistance. Interestingly, mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue are early events in the development of type II diabetes mellitus and are proposed to play a role in exacerbating insulin resistance. Although it has been demonstrated that skeletal muscle of insulin-resistant individuals has reduced mitochondria and mitochondrial dysfunction, whether this disruption of mitochondrial function is more widespread has not been explored. We hypothesize that this disruption of mitochondrial function is more systemic and thereby may contribute to the development of peripheral insulin resistance and possibly promote the myriad of complications associated with diabetes.  To test these assumptions, we propose an initial proof of concept study to evaluate mitochondrial biology in human platelets in normal volunteers, pre-diabetic and diabetic subjects to assess whether mitochondrial disruption/dysfunction evolves with the progression to type II diabetes. In parallel, proteomic analysis will be performed to evaluate whether the development of insulin resistance and diabetes confers a specific modulation in the biological signature of human platelets with disease progression. To delineate these concepts, we will evaluate study subject's glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and draw blood in parallel to study their platelets. Biological readouts will include: 1) the quantification of the mitochondrial proteome and electron transfer chain content; 2) the evaluation of platelet mitochondrial respiratory function and 3) to determine the mitochondrial reactive oxygen species capacity and defenses. If this hypothesis is validated, this study will show that the mitochondrial disruption/dysfunction is a more generalized finding in type II diabetes. Additionally, it would propose the use of platelets as potential biomarkers for early detection of mitochondrial function and assessment of disease. Finally, this would establish a peripheral blood readout of the modification of mitochondrial function as a novel approach to monitor the prevention and/or reversal of insulin resistance and diabetes in response to therapeutic strategies.

This is an in vivo study approved at the Research Ethics Committee, which will be conducted in 30 patients between 3 and 12 years. Patients included in the study should have at least one primary molar or permanent with deep active caries limited occlusal / proximal surfaces involving beyond the inner half of dentin. The investigators will considered from exclusion criteria children whose parents refuse to sign the informed consent document; children who do not cooperate with the clinical examination/treatment; children with syndromes or chronic systemic diseases; teeth with painful symptoms consistent with irreversible pulpitis or mobility; periodontal changes; roots with pathological resorption; cases of primary teeth roots in advanced stage of physiological resorption and patients that have made the use of any antibiotics during the study period or within three months prior to its beginning. The treatments will be carried out after local anesthesia and isolation of the operative field with a rubber dam. The removal of carious dentin surface demineralized necrotic and not subject to remineralization will be held with drill at low rpm under cooling with sterile saline. The removal of decayed tissue will start by the side walls and later on the pulp wall. After this time the intervention with aPDT using 0.01% methylene blue as photosensitizer will be held. Finally, the cavity is restored with adhesive and composite resin system. The dentin samples will be collected with the help of spoon sterile dentine in two stages: C1 after digging and C2 after aPDT. The microbiological analyzes will be conducted with counting of colony forming units (CFU / mg of carious dentin), blindly from coded samples. The viability of microorganisms will be evaluated in the following culture media: Brain Heart Infusion agar for feasibility total microorganisms; CHROMagar candida to Candida genus; Mitis Salaviarius agar with addition of bacitracin 0.2 U/mL, sucrose and glucose to Streptococcus mutans; Mitis Salivarius agar to total Streptococcus; Rogosa Agar to Lactobacillus spp. and enterococcosel for Enterococcus genus. The reproducibility of the counting method will be verified between triplicates. Microbiological data will be evaluated with appropriate statistical tests with a level of 5%. Based on this project is expected to prove the clinical efficacy of aPDT using 0.01% methylene blue as an adjunct in reducing of microorganisms from interior of deep carious lesions contributing to the clinical and radiographic success.

With improvements in surgical technique and perioperative patient management, morbidity and mortality related to liver resection have been greatly reduced. However, many patients with hepatocellular carcinoma have underlying liver disease. Severity of underlying liver disease plays an important role in decision making of resection extent. Therefore, liver failure and decreased liver function following liver resection still remains to be an critical issue.  Postresection liver failure is generally defined by serum total bilirubin greater than 3mg/dL and prothrombin time of less than 50% of normal (INR >1.7). Pathophysiology of postresection liver failure is not yet well known. However, sepsis after liver resection, small-for-size syndrome (SFSS), and ischemia/reperfusion injury are known to have important roles in persistant liver injury after resection.  After a liver resection, kupffer cells are drastically decreased and innate immunity of the patient is also damaged. This process causes the patient to be vulnerable to infection. In addition, with continuous endotoxin secretion, dysfunction in kupffer cells are triggered and liver regeneration is affected.  Complex mechanisms leading to dysfunctional kupffer cells and apoptosis and necrosis of hepatocytes are mediated by neutrophils, complement, reactive oxygen species, and acute inflammatory cytokines.  Recent studies have reported on many promising effects of the synthetic protease inhibitor, such as Gabexate mesilate. These include antioxidant effect, inhibition of acute inflammatory cytokine reaction, and anticoagulatory property. Based on these effects, synthetic protease inhibitor have gained attention in the role of hepatocyte protection after liver resection.  Currently, there is a report on the hepatocyte protective effects of Gabexate Mesilate on ischemia/reperfusion injury caused by the Pringle maneuver. However, with the advances in surgical technique and equipment, many surgeons now perform liver resection without Pringle maneuver. Therefore, this study was designed to determine effects of Gabexate Mesilate in the liver resection performed without Pringle maneuver.

Despite the use of Drug eluting stent (DES), the rate of restenosis remains 7% to 16% in diabetic patients, making it a challenging problem in interventional cardiology.  Still, in clinical trials, most of these attempts did not successfully limit neointimal formation after coronary stenting.  Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), like pioglitazone (pio) or rosiglitazone, are a novel class of oral antidiabetic agents currently used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  These agents increase insulin sensitivity and, as such, have favorable effects on blood glucose levels and the lipid profile in treated patients.  Beyond their metabolic action, TZDs have been shown to exhibit antiinflammatory and antiatherogenic effects in vascular cells in vitro and to limit lesion development in various animal models of arteriosclerosis.  Moreover, TZDs inhibit VSMC proliferation and migration, 2 critical processes in neointimal formation after coronary stenting.  Data from rodent models suggest that TZDs limit intimal proliferation after vascular injury, and in clinical studies with type 2 diabetic coronary artery disease (CAD) patients, TZDs have been shown to reduce neointimal formation as well as restenosis after coronary stent implantation.  Still, it remains unclear to what extend these effects depend on the metabolic action of these drugs and what might mainly be due to the improvement in glycemic control.  Recently a few reports on prevention of restenosis in type 2 diabetic patients (T2DM) with the use of TZDs as been published. All of them uses BMS as endoprosthetic devices. None of these evaluated the use of TZDs in combination with DES.  Aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of pioglitazone in prevention of in-stent restenosis after successful implantation of a sirolimus-eluting coronary stent for treatment of de-novo "complex" coronary vessel disease in patients with T2DM and stable coronary artery disease.

ROS	Completed	Effect of MVX (Titanium Dioxide) on the Microbial Colonization of Surfaces in an Intensive Care Unit	Environmental Contamination	Other: MVX (titanium dioxide)		https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02348346?term=ROS&rank=739	NCT02348346	Environmental cleanliness As antimicrobial resistance is a major and overall deteriorating public health problem international cooperation is necessary. Continued progress is needed to implement and improve programmes for the prevention and control of antimicrobial resistance and HAIs.  Environmental cleanliness might be one of the most important initiatives to reduce HAIs. Hospital surfaces are heavily contaminated with bacteria with the highest numbers on surfaces closest to the patients. Bed rails, nurse call buttons, curtains, towel dispensers, door handles, sinks, floors, clinical information stations, medical devices, stethoscopes, staff toilets etc. Actually, general hospital wards and Intensive Care Units are loaded with an abundance of potential pathogens 8,9,10. Surviving days, weeks or even months in the environment 11. Colonizing patients with bacteria from the hospital environment and getting HAIs or even die.  As most ventilator-associated pneumonias (VAPs) are the result of nosocomial microorganisms the environment plays an important role in the acquisition of pathogenic bacteria by contaminating health care workers hands and equipment 12,13. Furthermore, ICUs and wards struggle with colonized patients with ESBL-bacteria from sinks eventually leading to dead or outbreaks of group A streptococcus infections from contaminated curtains 14,15.  As key healthcare-associated pathogens have the capacity to persist for weeks to months on hospital surfaces indirect transmission is a serious threat, especially as antimicrobial resistance increases. Hospitalization in a room in which the previous patient had been colonized or infected with nosocomial pathogens (e.g. MRSA, VRE, multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas or C. difficile) has been shown to be a risk factor for colonization of infection with the same pathogen for the next patient16. Furthermore, the most important risk factor for hand and glove contamination of healthcare workers with multidrug-resistant bacteria has been demonstrated to be positive environmental cultures 17. To decrease the frequency and level of contamination of environmental surfaces the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends routine disinfection of medical equipment and environmental surfaces to prevent the spread of potential pathogens through the hospital ward or ICU 18. Improved room cleaning has shown to decrease the risk for MRSA, VRE and C. difficile acquisition. Unfortunately, environmental cleaning is frequently inadequate. Less than 50% of hospital room surfaces are adequately cleaned and disinfected even by environmental services personnel. Environmental services personnel have low wages, are under time pressure to clean rooms quickly with high turn-over rates of patients. Novel materials and cleaning technologies have been developed as ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) or hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV). However, both technologies are expensive and can just be used for terminal cleaning and not during routine daily care 16. Self-disinfecting surfaces may overcome these problems. Once applied antimicrobial surfaces will continuously reduce the bioburden of nosocomial pathogens preventing transmission and decrease HAIs.  MVX One of these self-disinfecting products is MVX. MVX contains titanium dioxide which by the use of nanotechnology is now available for use in the health sector. Working as a photocatalyticum it generates, in the presence of light, hydroxy radicals and oxygen radicals for at least five years after coating hospital surfaces (durability test TUV Rheinland). Laboratory tests show that MVX is effective in killing bacteria, viruses and fungi (see attachment 1 for summary test results).  The positive results reported on the effects of MVX from laboratory evaluations still have to be confirmed in the clinical setting. After getting the CE-marking Gelderse Vallei Hospital in Ede, the Netherlands, will be the first hospital in Europe to study the efficacy of MVX in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

ROS	Recruiting	Metformin in Kidney Disease	Chronic Kidney Disease;   Cardiovascular Disease;   Metabolic Syndrome	Drug: metformin;   Drug: Placebo	                Phase 2              cindy.a.booker@vanderbilt.edu	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02252081?term=ROS&rank=733	NCT02252081	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global health problem associated with substantial costs and resource utilization. Currently, CKD affects more than 500 million people worldwide. Patients with CKD have unacceptably high mortality rates due to cardiovascular (CV) causes, which are not entirely explained by traditional CV risk factors. The mortality rates in advanced CKD are six times higher compared to the Medicare population, with CVD accounting for the overwhelming majority of deaths. Insulin resistance (IR) is common in CKD patients and may represent a central link between CKD and the increased CVD risk observed in this population. Insulin resistance may increase CV risk by impairing and worsening endothelial function, increasing reactive oxygen species, and exacerbating systemic inflammation-hence, insulin resistance is considered a "non-traditional CV risk factor" in CKD.  Obesity (defined by a body mass index [BMI] of at least 30 kg/m2) is a major public health problem-the upward trend in obesity prevalence across regions and continents is a worldwide concern. Obesity increases the risk for cardiovascular disease and death. In the general population, obesity hastens death by 9.4 years. Obesity is an independent risk factor for CKD. Besides its contribution to the development of diabetes and hypertension, increased fat mass may also have a direct impact on kidney function.  In spite of the increasing prevalence of both obesity and CKD, the impact of obesity in the CKD population is not known, especially in terms of the exaggerated metabolic disturbances associated with their coexistence. It is highly likely that these two conditions have profound interactions that exaggerate the severity of the metabolic derangements when they coexist, particularly in regards to adipokine dysregulation, the risk of "insulin resistance", and downstream effects on vascular health. The current proposal will attempt to characterize the relative and combined impact of both obesity and CKD on metabolic disturbances, which may aid in risk stratification and identifying specific targets for intervention.  The ultimate goal of this proposal is to understand the relative and combined impact of obesity and CKD on the generation and maintenance of insulin resistance and their impact on cardiovascular health.  Specific Aim 2: To study the effects of metformin, an AMPK activator, on metabolic disturbances associated with obesity and moderate CKD.  S.A.2.a: To test if metformin will improve LAR in obese patients with moderate CKD compared to placebo.  S.A.2.b: To test if metformin will improve markers of systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction in obese patients with moderate CKD compared to placebo.  S.A.2.c: To test if metformin will improve atherosclerosis markers and reduce clinical CVD events in obese patients with moderate CKD compared to placebo.  Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that the administration of metformin in obese CKD patients will significantly improve the adipokine profiles-particularly through a reduction in LAR. Additionally, that it will improve systemic inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelial function, which may or may not be mediated by changes in adipokines. Finally, the investigators hypothesize that improvements in these markers of vascular health will translate into reduced arterial stiffness and less clinical CV events	United States, Tennessee || Tennessee Valley Healthcare System Nashville Campus, Nashville, TN || Recruiting || Nashville, Tennessee, United States, 37212-2637 || Contact: Adriana M Hung, MD MPH    615-873-6731 || Adriana.Hung@va.gov || Contact: Cindy A Booker    (615) 343-5828 || cindy.a.booker@vanderbilt.edu || Principal Investigator: Adriana M Hung, MD MPH	Contact: Adriana M Hung, MD MPH || (615) 873-6731 || Adriana.Hung@va.gov || Contact: Cindy A Booker || (615) 343-5828 || cindy.a.booker@vanderbilt.edu	Dysmetabolism of Chronic Kidney Disease and Vascular Health

A recent danish study furthermore showed that patients treated with a high inspiratory oxygen fraction during surgery had a higher 1 year mortality compared with patients treated with a low inspiratory fraction. This was especially significant among patients undergoing cancer surgery. A possible explanation, is that a high oxygen fraction results in oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction.  With this randomized cross-over study we wish to investigate the effect of a high inspiratory oxygen fraction on the endothelial function among healthy male volunteers. The primary outcome is the endothelial function assessed by the EndoPat system. Secondary outcomes are changes in oxidative biomarkers. Heart rate variability (HRV) recordings will serve as a measure for the effect of oxygen on the autonomic nervous system.

ROS	Recruiting	Fat Cell Size in Insulin Resistance	Obesity;   Adipose Cell Turn Over		asherman@nih.gov	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00341406?term=ROS&rank=729	NCT00341406	This study, conducted at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, will examine how insulin metabolism and cardiovascular risk are altered in response to weight loss. Insulin is a natural hormone that causes cells to remove glucose (sugar) from the blood. People who are insulin-sensitive remove glucose efficiently. People who are insulin-resistant require more insulin to remove glucose from the blood.  Adult volunteers will be recruited for this study through advertisements in local newspapers in communities around Stanford University.  Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:      Insulin sensitivity testing: Before beginning the study, participants will be tested for insulin sensitivity. For the test, two small catheters (plastic tubes) are placed into two veins - one for infusing glucose, insulin, and sandostatin (a drug that blocks insulin secretion from the pancreas), and one for drawing blood samples. The infusions are done over 3 hours. Blood samples are collected before, during, and at the end of the study to measure how well the cells remove glucose from the blood in response to insulin.    Research diet: Participants are assigned to a low-calorie diet tailored to the individual's metabolic rate. The diets contain either 40 or 60 percent of total calories as carbohydrates, 40 or 20 percent as fat, and the rest as protein. People with type 2 diabetes who are taking diabetes medicine with have a diet of 45 to 50 percent carbohydrates, 35 to 40 percent fat, and the rest protein.    Meal profile: Before beginning the diet and after 4 months on the diet, participants are tested for the effects of the various study diets on control of blood sugar and fats. On the day of each test, participants have a physical examination and provide a medical history. Then, a small catheter is placed in a vein. Blood samples are drawn before breakfast and then hourly for up to 8 hours.    Participants who are diabetic are randomly assigned to take one of three diabetes medications - rosiglitazone, glucophage, or a sulfonylurea compound - to help control blood glucose levels.    Magnetic resonance imaging: This diagnostic test uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to show structural and chemical changes in tissues. During the scan, the participant lies on a table in a narrow cylinder containing a magnetic field, wearing ear plugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur during the scanning process. He or she can speak with a staff member via an intercom system at all times during the procedure.    In addition to these procedures, patients may be asked to have a fat cell biopsy. This is done to determine whether insulin-resistant people have fewer fat cells but more fat per cell than insulin-sensitive people. For this test, a small piece of fat tissue is surgically removed, under local anesthetic, from an area of the lower abdomen. With the participant's consent, genetic testing may be done on the fat tissue sample to look for genes that may link central obesity to insulin resistance.  Some participants may be asked to be followed for an additional 3 months after completion of the study for a continued weight loss program. The follow-up includes weekly visits for weight measurements and a review of food records.

ROS	Completed	Zinc Supplementation on Markers of Oxidative Stress in Post Operative Colorectal Cancer During Chemotherapy Cycles	Chemotherapy;   Colorectal Cancer	Dietary Supplement: Zinc;   Other: Placebo	University of S o Paulo	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02106806?term=ROS&rank=731	NCT02106806	Objective: To determine the oxidative stress during cycles of chemotherapy in patients after surgery for colorectal cancer, with or without oral zinc supplementation. Subjects: Twenty four adults from both genders participated in this study. All patients underwent stage II, III or IV colorectal cancer surgical resection and were starting chemotherapy in HCFMRP- USP. Patients were randomized into two groups. The first one (QTx-Zn Group, n=10) received 70 mg/d of zinc orally and the second one received placebo (QTx-Placebo Group, n=14) for 16 weeks. The study also included 30 healthy volunteers matched for age, gender and socioeconomic status, who received 70 mg/d of zinc supplement (Control-Zn Group, n=21) or placebo (Control-Placebo Group, n=9) for 16 weeks. Methods: The questionnaires about dietary intake (semiquantitative food frequency and food record), fatigue and quality of life (FACIT-F) and questionnaires that assess the side effects of chemotherapy (CTCAE) were evaluated. Anthropometry and bioelectrical impedance measurements were made. Blood collection was performed before the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th cycles of chemotherapy (median duration of 21 days among cicles). Routine laboratory tests, vitamin E and markers anti and pro-oxidants (MDA, SOD, GPx and isoprostane) ere determined. The control group underwent the same procedures, except for chemotherapy. A longitudinal linear mixed effects model was adjusted for each of the variables of interest. The models were fitted using PROC MIXED of SAS version 9 (SAS, CARY, NC, USA). To analyze the association of categorical variables in the different items of the CTCAE, the investigators used the Fisher exact test. Results: The oral zinc supplementation was sufficient to increase plasma levels of zinc and did not alter food intake, body composition and routine laboratory evaluation of patients undergoing chemotherapy for colorectal cancer. Compared with QTx-Placebo Group, QTx-Zn Group showed lower prevalence of complaint on the salivary gland (17 vs. 75%). Fatigue (43 ¡À 6 vs. 36 ¡À 13) and quality of life (126 ¡À 160 vs. 116 ¡À 27) has become worst in the period between the 1st and 4th cycles of QTx in QTx-Placebo Group. When compared with QTx-Placebo Group, QTx-Zn Group had higher values of SOD before the 1st (2297 ¡À 503 vs. 1604 ¡À 352 USOD/g Hb), 2nd (2037 ¡À 515 vs. 1712 ¡À 417 USOD/g Hb) and 4th (2202 ¡À 323 vs. 1821 ¡À 360 USOD/g Hb) cycles of QTx. GPx values decreased in QTx-Zn Group before the 3rd cycle of QTx (48.5 ¡À 7.0 vs. 54.3 ¡À 2.3 mol NADPH/min/gHb). Conclusions: These data suggest that zinc supplementation reduces complaints related to the change in salivary gland, preserving the quality of life and preventing the worsening of fatigue. The increase in SOD can be attributed to zinc supplementation per se, whereas this mineral is a cofactor that endogenous antioxidant enzyme. The highest activity of SOD increases the production of H2O2, whose detoxification involves the participation of GPx, justifying its reduction. There were no changes in plasma levels of vitamin E, MDA and isoprostane during the study period. Considering the values of MDA and isoprostane, the data indicate that regardless of zinc supplementation, the lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane was unchanged during chemotherapy.

ROS	Unknown  	Bone Turnover in Type 2 Diabetes Patients	Type 2 Diabetes	Drug: Sitagliptin;   Drug: Placebo	                Phase 4              	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00732121?term=ROS&rank=727	NCT00732121	Background:  Incretin hormones are hormones produced by the gut in response to food intake. These hormones help the body to control the metabolism of glucose (sugar). In particular, two incretin hormones (GLP-1 and GIP) cause the pancreas to secrete more insulin in response to high blood glucose levels. This helps the body to metabolize the glucose more effectively, lowering blood sugar levels. In addition to their effects on the pancreas, GLP-1 and GIP have effects on other tissues, including the brain, gut, fat cells and bone. A new class of oral drugs developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) called DPP-4 inhibitors increases levels of the active forms of GLP-1 and GIP in the body by preventing their breakdown. This study tests whether a medicine in this class called sitagliptin (Januvia), which is commonly used to treat T2DM, affects markers of bone turnover in patients with T2DM. The hypothesis is that treatment with sitagliptin will increase markers of bone formation and decrease markers of bone resorption during a mixed meal, by enhancing active circulating levels of GLP-1, GIP and GLP-2.  Methods:  To address this question we will recruit patients with T2DM whose diabetes is controlled with either diet+exercise or with metformin (another medicine commonly used to treat T2DM). Subjects will undergo measurement of body fat and bone mineral density by DEXA scanning and a 3-hour mixed meal test. During the mixed meal test blood samples will be taken to measure how much GLP-1 and GIP are produced. Markers of bone formation will also be measured in blood samples obtained during the mixed meal test. Subjects will then be randomly assigned to 8 weeks of treatment with either sitagliptin (100 mg/day) or matching placebo (an inactive tablet that does not contain medication). Subjects will be seen 4 weeks after commencing treatment to assess safety and tolerability. After 8 weeks of treatment the meal test will be repeated. Subjects will then be washed off of their initial treatment (sitagliptin or placebo) for 1 week (that is, they will receive no study medication during this period). After the washout period, they will commence a second 8-week period of treatment with the other study medication (that is, if they received sitagliptin initially, they will receive placebo during period 2 and vice-versa). At the end of period 2, subjects will undergo a third mixed meal test with measurement of GLP-1, GIP and markers of bone turnover.  Significance:  Recent studies suggest that oral antidiabetic medications of the thiazolidinedione class, such as rosiglitazone (Avandia) and pioglitazone (Actos), may weaken bones, increasing the risk of fractures in older women with diabetes. The proposed study will test whether drugs of the DPP-4 inhibitor class, such as sitagliptin (Januvia), have beneficial effects on bone turnover by increasing the activity of GLP-1 and GIP. Results of this pilot study may suggest the need to perform longer-term studies to determine whether DPP-4 inhibitors increase bone mineral density and reduce the risk of fractures in patients with diabetes.

ROS	Enrolling by invitation	China Obstetrics Alliance Cohort Study	Preeclampsia			https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03038555?term=ROS&rank=726	NCT03038555	Preeclampsia (PE) is one of a common type of hypertensive disorder complicating pregnancy (HDCP). It is a class of clinical syndromes which shows relevant symptoms, hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks pregnant as main characteristic, and may accompany with fetal anomaly and systemic multi-system organs damage. Several complications, such as eclamptic seizures, coma, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), cardiac failure, pneumonedema, hepatic failure, kidney failure, placental abruption and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), may be threat to the life of the mother as well as fetal. Thus, the disease is one of the core issues that cause the maternal and perinatal death. Morbidity of PE is approximately 3% to 5%. Morbidity has significant differences between different populations. According to the data, from 1995 to 2004, HDCP morbidity in four hospitals in Guangzhou was 5.78%, and in the HDCP, mild preeclampsia and severe preeclampsia were accounted for 72.22% and 27.78% respectively. Meanwhile, HDCP morbidity decreased from 9.4% (1984 to 1989) to 5.57% (1989 to 1998).  In 1996, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) gave new classification of HDCP based on the characteristic of disease symptoms, divide into five groups; gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia, chronic hypertension complicated with preeclampsia and chronic hypertension. The pathogenesis of PE remains unclear so far. The frequent sight is that PE caused by multiple reactions by a number of factors affect. Physiologically, mainly altered of PE is increased blood viscosity and systemic vascular spasm which cause hypoxic-ischemic of multiple key organs, such as the placenta, kidney, liver and brain. The research theory includes abnormal trophoblast invasion, immune response abnormal or increase, genetic susceptibility, coagulation disorders or thrombophilia, abnormal angiogenesis, endothelial cell damage, abnormal levels of carbonic oxide, increase of oxygen radical, abnormal metabolism of calcium ion, heterotrophia and so on. However, there are numbers of epidemiologic study have analyzed high risk factor of PE which provides significant medical evidence of prevention, early diagnosis and early treatment for PE, there is only little study focus on susceptibility gene and pathogenic genetic variation. Nowadays, there are numerous clinical phenotype are considered to exist, different phenotype gives different inheritance and epigenetics. Thus, our group will examine the onset of type and characteristics of PE by a retrospective cohort study to discuss if susceptibility gene and pathogenic genetic variation were existing in PE patients, also to find the relativity between clinical phenotype and genotype. Moreover, this study is trying to reach the effect of PE on the patients' health as well as their children. Thus, can predict the health status of PE patients and their children, and so can prevent (avoid or delay) of the patients from late complications and disease in their children.

ROS	Unknown  	Laser Assisted Treatment of Chronic Sinusitis With and Without Light Activated Agents	Rhinosinusitis	Device: Laser + ICG;   Device: Laser only	vkizhner@gmail.com	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00948519?term=ROS&rank=725	NCT00948519	Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is common disorder which affects up to 13% of the US population. CRS affects numerous Quality of Life (QOL) factors including smell, sleep and communication. The common treatment for medically noncompliant CRS is Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS).  As the disease course is generally idle, prolonged medical treatment guidelines are for antibiotic treatment, prescribed accordingly following appropriately obtained nasal cultures, lasting weeks with or without additional topical or oral steroid treatment. While FESS success rate is a general notion, a failure rate of primary FESS is as high as 2-24%2, with a Cochrane review even suggesting that FESS though a safe procedure is of no benefit more than medical management.  With that in mind as we address the failed FESS, new bacteria emerge. The new bacteria in CRS are Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates (36%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (25%), Streptococcus viridans (8.3%), Corynebacterium (4.6%), and anaerobes (6.4%).  Patients not relieved by primary FESS demonstrate a significant rise in Pseudomonas and MRSA bacteria positive cultures. Moreover surgical success for patients with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa positive cultures is usually reduced.  Bacterial killing, by usage of light-activated agents such as Indocyanine Green (ICG) with exposure to the specific wavelength, eventually produces bacterial killing. Mechanisms primarily involved are production of reactive oxygen species (i.e. singlet oxygen and free radicals) which can then kill bacteria. ICG by itself does not have any bacterial killing effect.  Low level laser therapy (LLLT) was shown to be effective as a bactericidal by single and multiple wave exposures.  The study purpose is to treat CRS with an alternative to antibiotics, thus sparing volunteers from prolonged antibiotics use and its possible side effects, not to mention the cost and growth of resistant bacteria. We believe that by combining ICG with light or even by light alone we can produce you a beneficial effect. Although this has been shown to kill bacteria in lab or animal studies it is still investigational for humans. The study will have two arms: ICG + laser and laser only arm. ICG will be applied locally in the nasal passage (internally) followed by laser activation with a power setting of 6W. The laser will be activated with a diffuser mode meaning light of a specific known wavelength will be delivered evenly in the nasal cavity and not as a beam. Laser only treatment plan will be the same only without ICG. Volunteers will be assigned to one of the groups randomly meaning you have a 50% chance of enrolling to each treatment group.

ROS	Unknown  	Study Effects of Ginkgo Biloba Extract on Endothelial Cell Function and Genetic Effects on the Response to Ginkgo Biloba Extract in Diabetic Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease	Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus;   Coronary Artery Disease	Drug: Ginkgo Biloba Extract (GBE)	                Phase 4              Division of Cardiology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01038050?term=ROS&rank=724	NCT01038050	Type 2 diabetes is associated with a markedly increased risk for atherosclerotic coronary arteries and cerebrovascular diseases. The major cause of death in diabetic patients is cardiovascular disease in the world including Taiwan. Atherosclerosis is a progressive disease characterized by the response of the vessel wall to chronic, multifactorial injury, which leads ultimately to the formation of atheromatous or fibrous plaques. Endothelial dysfunction is thought to be the initial stage of atherosclerosis. Endothelial dysfunction leads to impaired control of vascular tone, a decreased in the release of anti-inflammatory factors and reduced availability of nitric oxide. Endothelial dysfunction portends diabetic vasculopathy. The loss of intact endothelial integrity and function sets in motion a cascade of serial events that lead to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular complications.  The standard extracts of G. biloba leaves [G. biloba extract (GBE)] are now demonstrated the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and neuroprotective effects. The mixture of biologically active ingredients in GBE accounts for the pleiotropic effects, including antioxidant effects, inhibition of platelet aggregation and thromboxane B2 production, vasodilation and modulation of cholesterol metabolism. Clinically, GBE was widely used in management of vertigo¡¢dementia and improving peripheral circulation. In our previous study, ginkgo biloba extract inhibits tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced reactive oxygen species generation, transcription factor activation, and cell adhesion molecule expression in human aortic endothelial cells. In addition, the similar benefit of prevention atherosclerosis was also found in animal study.  Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a factor associated with higher risk of developing some vascular disease and also a rate-limiting enzyme in heme degradation, leading to the generation of free iron, biliverdin, and carbon monoxide (CO). CO exerts potent antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory effects in the vascular walls, thereby influencing neointimal formation after vascular injury. In addition, biliverdin is subsequently metabolized to bilirubin by the enzyme biliverdin reductase. Therefore, induction of HO-1 elicits potent anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, antithrombotic, and antioxidant effects in the circulation via the generation of CO and bilirubin. Interestingly, recent study found that a long guanidine thymidine dinucleotide repeat [(GT) n¨R 30] in the HO-1 promotor, which is linked to impaired inducibility, is associated with a higher frequency of vascular access failure.  In the present study, we will investigate the effect of GBE on recovering endothelial dysfunction and inflammation in diabetic patients with stable coronary artery disease. In particularly, we intend to determine whether the GBE modulates the HO-1 expression and investigate whose genotyping including some candidate gene about atherosclerosis and hypertension will have most therapeutic effect of GBE.

Individuals with metabolic syndrome often have impaired glucose tolerance, which is a condition where blood sugar is normal when fasting (before eating), but is too high after drinking a sugary drink. This is due to an abnormality in the body's sensitivity to insulin (insulin resistance), which is due in part to an inability of the muscle to take up glucose.  People with metabolic syndrome have inflammation in their fat tissue and in their blood stream, and the changes in the level of inflammatory chemicals produced by cells in your fat tissues will be studied. One possible source of the inflammation may be the bacteria in the intestine. When individuals eat fatty foods, some of the bacterial products become attached to the fat in their blood and then get directed to fat tissue. The investigators wish to determine whether individuals have an excessive amount of inflammation in their fat tissues, and whether this inflammation comes from the bacteria in their intestines. To determine this, the investigators wish to treat individuals with an antibiotic that reduces the bacteria in their intestines and in their blood, and determine whether this reduces their overall level of inflammation.

ROS	Unknown  	Secretin-Assisted Computed Tomography Scan and Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Improving Pancreatic Tumor Conspicuity	Pancreas Cancer	Drug: Secretin Synthetic Human (RG1068)	                Early Phase 1              	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01371240?term=ROS&rank=728	NCT01371240	Accurate preoperative tumor detection and staging are fundamental for treating patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Patients with unresectable tumors can benefit from being spared an extensive operation associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, cost, and pain. On the other hand, patients with localized disease, which is amenable to surgical removal, have the option of operation. Therefore, accurate staging of pancreatic cancer requires the detection of the tumor, and evaluation of its size, its relationship to major peri-pancreatic vascular structures and portal venous system, locoregional lymph nodes, and distant metastases. Multiple imaging techniques have been used to evaluate the pancreas. Although, at this point, no consensus exists as to the best staging algorithm, multidetector (MD) computed tomogrophy (CT) and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide sufficient information for the management of most patients.  Patients with a tumor larger than 3 cm are characterized as non-surgical. CT sensitivity in detecting small pancreatic tumors of less than 2 cm is low. Multiple methods have been suggested to increase the sensitivity of CT. The sensitivity of CT increases with using multidetector CT which now has an accuracy rate of about 95-97% for initial detection and approximating that of 100% for staging.  Secretin (a natural hormone produced by the duodenal mucosal cells) is known to increase blood flow to the pancreas. The principal use of secretin in imaging today is in exocrine function of the pancreas or morphological evaluation of the pancreatic duct under ultrasound or MRI. Theoretically, pancreatic contrast enhancement should also increase after secretin administration. This would imply that tumor conspicuity might also be increased if contrast enhancement of the normal pancreas increases. Secretin CT has been advocated by other centers to improve depiction of the ampulla and periampullary/duodenal diseases and to improve contrast enhancement. O'Connell et al, used secretin in patients suspected or with known pancreatic mass and concluded that administration of intravenous secretin leads to greater enhancement of the pancreas with greater tumor conspicuity, than imaging without secretin.  MRI of the pancreas has undergone a major change because it can provide noninvasive images of the pancreatic ducts and the parenchyma. MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) enables detection of anatomic variants such as pancreas divisum. Although contrast material-enhanced CT is still considered the gold standard in acute pancreatitis and for the detection of calcifications in chronic pancreatitis, MR imaging and secretin-enhanced MRCP are useful in evaluating pseudocysts and pancreatic disruption.  The role of MR is still debated in pancreatic neoplasms except the cystic lesions where MR imaging provides critical information regarding the lesion's content and a possible communication with the pancreatic ducts. Although some articles have shown that MRI was equivalent to CT in diagnosis and staging, others have shown the opposite. Nishiharu et al. found comparable tumor detection but a benefit with CT, notably for peripancreatic and vascular invasion. Comparing CT, echoendoscopy, and MRI, Soriano et al. demonstrated that CT showed the highest level of precision in primary tumor staging, local-regional staging, vascular invasion, distant metastases, Tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging, and tumor resectability. MRI retains its originality in imaging the parenchyma, the pancreatic and biliary ducts, and vascular structures; however, in many institutions, CT remains the reference imaging choice for diagnosing and staging pancreatic cancer. Other than CT's advantages for the tumor, its excellent spatial resolution also provides detailed reconstructions in all planes and arterial mapping and therefore makes it possible to search for surgical contraindications such as celiac trunk stenosis. MRI is still used today as a second-intention tool when there is doubt or when CT and echoendoscopy are not sufficiently conclusive; it is not currently recommended to use MRI in first-intention diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.  The aim of this pilot study is to determine whether the administration of intravenous secretin before contrast-enhanced CT and MRI improves pancreatic enhancement and pancreatic tumor conspicuity and to evaluate which technique is more appropriate for pancreatic tumor detection, staging and evaluation of resectability.

ROS	Completed	High-intensity Exercise and Fall Prevention Boot Camp for Parkinson's Disease	Parkinson's Disease	Other: High intensity exercise and balance training;   Other: Usual care arm exercise	                Phase 2              	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02230267?term=ROS&rank=747	NCT02230267	Several animal and human epidemiologic studies have provided evidence that exercise may be neuroprotective in Parkinson's disease (PD). Exercise may forestall diagnosis and, in the case of those who have already been diagnosed with PD, it may slow the observed neurodegeneration. Unfortunately, because this line of research is in early stages, there is little evidence to indicate what biological mechanisms underlie the neuroprotection that is conferred with exercise. Toward this end, it is possible that an interaction between endogenous antioxidant enzymes, inflammatory processes, and reactive oxygen species may be associated with exercise improvements in PD.  One of the most common reasons for premature death in PD is falls. Several meta-analyses have concluded that exercise training programs focused on balance and/or strength training are effective at improving aspects of balance. Taken together, the current body of evidence suggests that exercise may be neuroprotective and balance/strength training may decrease the likelihood of a fall. The combination of these efficacious treatment modalities (exercise and balance/strength training) in a comprehensive treatment approach to improve PD symptoms and balance has been previously reported at relatively mild or moderate exercise intensities. Because recent research has suggested that patients with PD may benefit more from more physically intense programs, we are proposing a more aggressive approach with regard to exercise intensity and frequency in the present trial. The primary purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and safety of a high intensity exercise approach to PD. A secondary purpose is to determine the trajectory of change in outcomes over the duration of the trial from a high intensity fall prevention program. It is hoped that a signal of efficacy will allow this trial to progress to a comparative effectiveness trial. An important innovative design element is collecting biological assays to better understand the mechanism underlying the anticipated clinical improvements.  Aim 1 is to test the feasibility of a high-intensity exercise and fall prevention boot camp (HIBC) in patients with PD by analyzing adherence and whether they achieve minimum Centers for Disease Control exercise standards (150 min/wk moderate level aerobic exercise; strengthening at least two times per week) for the duration of the trial. Aim 2 is to determine if participation in an 8-week HIBC under the direction of a physical therapist is safe for individuals with PD. Secondary Aim 3 is to determine if participation in an 8-week HIBC will produce a signal of efficacy for several physical outcomes: falls per physical activity ratio, balance efficacy, motor activity, fatigue, muscle strength, bone health, cognition/mood, and quality of life. Secondary Aim 4 is to determine if participation in an 8-week HIBC will produce a signal of efficacy for biological outcomes, anti-inflammatory cytokines and anti-oxidant enzymes. An additional exploratory aim will be an analysis of BDNF val66val, val66met, met66met polymorphisms to determine if there is a differential response to exercise.  This trial is innovative because it utilizes a high intensity comprehensive exercise treatment approach (aerobic exercise, strengthening, and balance training). To our knowledge, there have been no trials of individuals with PD who have participated in a trial of this intensity in a group "boot camp" setting. Another innovative design element is the use of three novel assessments: biological assays of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, endogenous anti-oxidant enzymes and a novel assessment of falls (falls per physical activity ratio).  Participants will be randomly assigned into either an 8-week HIBC group or an 8-week usual care control group (standard, low intensity group therapy class) under the direction of physical therapists. Each group will have 15 participants with a 1:5 patient-to-therapist ratio. The HIBC will be 1.5 hours daily, Monday through Friday. Participants will be required to attend 3 out of the 5 days. The protocol of the HIBC will include the following exercise components: A. 30 minutes of moderate-high intensity aerobic exercise; B. 15 minutes of strengthening the major muscle groups; C. 15 minutes of balance training; and, D. 15 minutes of interspersed rest and stretching. Participants will rotate through these four exercise components. Participants will have one baseline test and assessments at the 2-week, 4 week, 8-week, and 6-month points. Outcomes of the primary aims (Aim 1 and Aim 2) will be frequency counts of participation, adverse events, and compliance with exercise. The outcomes for the secondary aims will include measures of balance and falls, physical capacity, fatigue, exercise/physical activity behavior, and biological assays.

Although the vast majority of these victims sustain mild TBI, many still develop headache, difficulty concentrating, and decreased memory with potential for serious long-term consequences. In particular, mild TBI is an important consequence of combat-related injuries sustained by military personnel and sports-related injuries in young adults. Unfortunately, treatment of mild TBI is usually limited to oral analgesics for headache pain such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin or Advil). Since there are no previous randomized trials of these medications for mild TBI, their comparative effectiveness is not known. Increasing animal based evidence suggests that mild TBI is related to brain cell injury caused by overexpression of a cellular enzyme (COX-2) that causes neuroinflammation. Fortunately, inhibition of COX-2 is easily achieved using ibuprofen. We hypothesize that head injured patients treated with ibuprofen will have a lower incidence of mild TBI symptoms than patients treated with acetaminophen. We will conduct a randomized clinical trial to measure the comparative effects of ibuprofen versus acetaminophen on the incidence of specific symptoms of mild TBI in emergency department patients with head injury.

The average age of a patient with subarachnoid haemorrhage is 50 years, although it is often seen in younger people (25-45 years). Despite modern medicine, the death and disability rate remains high both from the initial bleed and from the associated complications such as vasospasm. This is characterised by neurological impairment seen following the bleed. Despite modern treatment this is still associated with a poor outcome. This has significant implications due to the long term intensive neuro-rehabilitation these patients will require.  A recent study has shown that placing a small drain in the lower back following a subarachnoid haemorrhage may reduce the chance of vasospasm occurring and result in a better outcome. This trial was not optimally performed and so a trial is needed to look at this in more detail. The investigators have set up such a trial in our neurosurgical unit. If the investigators confirm that there is an improvement in patient outcome, it will change our practice in the future.

Giving combination chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. A bone marrow transplant, using bone marrow from the patient, may be able to replace blood-forming cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy. It is not yet know which combination chemotherapy schedule is more effective, when given before surgery and an autologous bone marrow transplant, in treating patients with disseminated neuroblastoma.

They are characterized by low blood counts that require frequent blood transfusions. The development of iron overload in these patients is inevitable. The iron deposits in vital organs such as the heart and the liver and can lead to organ dysfunction. Deferasirox is a well-studied drug that helps remove iron from the body. Most people with this disorder die due to progression of their disease to acute leukemia through multiple mechanisms. Iron overload in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes has been shown to be associated with shorter survival, and potentially a higher chance of leukemia. In a certain subgroup of higher risk patients, the drug azacitidine has been shown to decrease the chance of progression to leukemia and death from it. Thus, it is presently the standard of care for these patients. However, 50% of higher risk patients are still unresponsive to this medication, leaving a large group of patients for which other treatment options are emergently needed. Given that a large proportion of higher risk MDS patients fail to respond to azacitidine, and the evidence that iron deposition may lead to increased leukemic transformation, we would like to study whether iron removal from the body with deferasirox potentiates azacitidine in its effects on overall survival, as well as the chance of leukemia transformation. This question needs to be addressed in a randomized controlled trial, and the first step is a preliminary study to determine if the combination of azacitidine and deferasirox has any biologic effect. This study will determine whether this combination leads to blood count improvement over azacitidine alone. If this drug combination ultimately proves more useful than azacitidine alone with respect to survival, this has the potential to impact the care of a large proportion of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.

Current treatments, including behavioral weight management programs, weight loss surgery, and pharmacotherapy, tend to be high in cost and have limited reach, reducing the ability of these treatments to address the population-wide scope of the obesity epidemic. Recent advances in technology that improve the ease of self-monitoring and provide targeted feedback offer promise to help larger groups of individuals to lose weight. Despite the commercial popularity of these products, however, little research has been conducted to evaluate their impact on excess body weight or to determine how they should ideally be implemented. Two key questions need to be addressed. First, is use of self-monitoring technology sufficient to produce weight loss, or must this technology be combined with interventionist contact  Second, how cost-effective is a technology-based intervention, with and without interventionist contact  The current study is small prospective, randomized pilot study comparing a self-guided self-monitoring condition (SC) to a technology only condition (TECH) and a technology plus interventionist support condition (TECH+INT). All participants will all be given basic weight management information knowledge and randomized to one of three conditions. Participants in the self-guided self-monitoring condition (SC) will receive traditional paper self-monitoring logs, a standard body weight scale, and a pedometer and calorie book; participants in the technology-based condition (TECH) will receive an electronic activity monitor and WiFi-enabled body weight scale, and will track caloric intake via an associated website; and participants in the interventionist contact condition (TECH+INT) will receive the same technology as in the TECH condition, combined with weekly interventionist contact delivered via telephone.

Asthma, an inflammatory disorder of the airway, appears to be determined by multiple interacting genetic and environmental factors. Such risk factors include allergic responses, small airways, excess body weight, specific properties of airway smooth muscle, airway and generalized metabolic and inflammatory homeostasis, and exposures to environmental irritants, allergens, and psychosocial stressors. To date, asthma treatment strategies have been guided by "severity" guidelines rather than by characteristics of the child's specific phenotype (a child's underlying allergic tendency, extent of airway inflammation and airway smooth muscle dysfunction, or underlying obesity and metabolic perturbations). The growing availability of new classes of asthma medications that more directly target specific pathophysiological derangements will require accessing data on each child's asthma risk profiles to optimize selection of medications and other interventions that most specifically address the underlying pathophysiology while minimizing adverse treatment side effects.  The investigators propose to develop a model program for collecting relevant clinical information and genetic data on a high risk group of asthmatic children, including data on common co-morbidities, specifically obesity and sleep disorders; use this information to develop a comprehensive model database for characterizing children according to their health profiles; and use this characterization to initiate targeted interventions, while continuing long term follow up of these children to determine differential responsiveness to medications.

Subjects that meet the inclusion criteria and have provided informed consent will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 fashion to one of the two dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) regimen: aspirin + clopidogrel (standard of care) vs. aspirin + ticagrelor (experimental arm).  DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel for at least 6 months (preferably 12 months) is the current gold-standard for patients receiving PCI and drug eluting stent implantation for SCAD. No data supports a different strategy and/or approach in COPD patients undergoing PCI. Ticagrelor, a new P2Y12 inhibitor, showed a significantly higher platelet inhibition as compared to clopidogrel. Recently, ticagrelor administration has been associated with a positive effect on endothelial function and a modulation of proinflammatory signalling. These actions are mediated by a significant influence of adenosine uptake. Higher platelet reactivity, chronic inflammatory response, heightened endothelial dysfunction characterized COPD patients with concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD). The investigators speculated that COPD patients undergoing PCI for stable CAD (SCAD) had a risk profile similar to that of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) patients. Accordingly, COPD patients undergoing PCI for SCAD may obtain a stronger benefit by ticagrelor as compared to clopidogrel. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether ticagrelor, is superior to clopidogrel, in reducing endothelial dysfunction , platelet reactivity (PR) and inflammation profile of patients with stable CAD and COPD. Ticagrelor will be administered according PLATO trial and international guidelines (180 mg as loading dose, 90 mg x 2 daily as maintenance dose). As suggested by international guidelines, the control group will be patients with current gold standard treatment for SCAD treated with PCI (aspirin + clopidogrel 75 mg daily). The evaluation of endothelial dysfunction, PR and inflammation profile will be repeated after 30 days and will be compared to baseline values.

Nevertheless, it is not known physical training pattern more beneficial for these patients. The reasons for heterogeneity and lack of consistency of the results described by published intervention programs may be the diversity of isolated - resistance, endurance or proprioceptive trainings - or a combination of them. There are no studies with a combined program of this three kinds of physical training.  The objective of this study is to know if a multicomponent physical training program during 180 days in dwelling-community frail geriatric patients can improve scores on functional, activities of daily living, mood, cognitive and quality of life scales and producing changes in blood levels of biological and genetic markers.

It was already demonstrated the positive impact of phosphodiesterase type 5A (PDE5A) inhibition in several models of cardiomyopathy and in a model of endocrine cardiomyopathy due to type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this patients with diabetic cardiomyopathy it was demonstrated an improvement in cardiac kinetic, geometry and performance parameters and reduction of the ambulatory measurement of waist circumference.  This represents the first study that evaluate heart remodeling and performance changes and metabolic/immunological/molecular parameters after 5-months of Tadalafil 20 mg in Cushing's Syndrome cardiomyopathy. The proposed research will test whether phosphodiesterase 5A inhibition could become a new target for anti-remodeling drugs and to discover molecular pathways affected by this class of drugs and a network of circulating markers (miRNA) for the early diagnosis of Cushing's Syndrome cardiomyopathy.

Treatment of T2D is often done by medication, changing the diet and increased physical activity. It is well established that physical training has a positive effect on the pathology of T2D such as increased insulin sensitivity and reduced fasting plasma glucose (7) and blood lipids (15). It is also well known that in healthy subjects endurance training increases mitochondrial density, lipid oxidation during submaximal exercise, and results in a number of qualitative changes in the control of OXPHOS (24). However, the effect of physical training on the mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle of patients with T2D has not been investigated.  The purpose of this project is to investigate the effect of physical training on the mitochondrial respiratory function in muscles of patients with T2D. Skeletal muscle biopsies will be taken before and after 10 weeks of physical training in patients with T2D and matched control subjects. Mitochondria will be isolated from the muscle biopsies, and respiratory function, free radical production and UCP3 will be determined. Furthermore, measures of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), heart rate and capillary lactate concentrations and carbohydrate and lipid oxidation will be determined partly to verify an increased aerobic capacity and partly to investigate the changes in these factors in T2D patients.

The pro-inflammatory effect could be the result of activation of Hypoxia Inducible Factor, a transcription factor that is known to activate many cell systems aimed at cell survival, including the inflammatory response. The anti-inflammatory effects of hyperoxia could be the annihilation of Hypoxia Inducible Factor, but also a decrease in inflammation due to oxygen toxicity resulting in a decrease in clearance of pathogens. These effects have been sparsely studied in humans. Therefore, we hypothesize that hypoxia results in an increase in Hypoxia Inducible Factor in circulating leukocytes and increases inflammatory reactions, whereas hyperoxia decreases these reactions.

ROS	Active, not recruiting	Low-level Laser Therapy in Chronic Kidney Disease	Kidney Failure, Chronic	Other: Low-Level Light Therapy		https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02944760?term=ROS&rank=849	NCT02944760	Chronic kidney disease is a renal injury and progressive and irreversible loss of kidney function and in its most advanced stage is called chronic renal failure. Although hemodialysis replace some kidney function, patients suffer some alterations characterized by "uremic syndrome" typically expressed by: motor neuropathy and/or autonomic neuropathy, cardiac or musculoskeletal myopathies, peripheral vascular changes, among others. Thus, the functional capacity and ability to exercise presents diminished these patients. The aim of this study is to verify the acute effect of low level laser therapy on the functional capacity of these individuals.  The research will be developed in the hemodialysis unit of the Santa Clara hospital of Santa Casa de Misericordia de Porto Alegre and the patients will be evaluated before and immediately after the application of laser therapy protocol. Before the protocol will be evaluated pain in the lower limbs, Borg scale, level of physical activity through the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and blood collection will be held for later analysis parameters of biochemical oxidative stress and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage.  The laser therapy protocol will be applied in 6 points in quadriceps and 4 points in the gastrocnemius, bilaterally. After application, will be held the 6-minute walk test, effort subjective perception by Borg scale, assessment of pain in the lower limbs with visual analog scale and a new blood sample for further analysis. Patients will be randomized in two groups. The intervention group (IG), which will be held laser therapy and placebo group (PG), where the laser therapy will be placebo mode applied. The application will take place with the Chattanooga device, with the laser diode cluster probe from the same manufacturer consisting of five diodes 850 nanometers (nm) and power output of 200 milliwatts (mW). It is irradiated 6 points in quadriceps and 4 points in gastrocnemius, bilaterally.

Although they allow hemodynamic success to be obtained, they can leave some regional blood flows impaired, especially the hepatosplanchnic perfusion, which contributes to multiple organ failure.  Dopexamine is a structural and synthetic analog of dopamine that exerts systemic and gut vasodilation and stimulates cardiac contraction. In experimental models, dopexamine has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory properties and to protect the hepatic ultra structure. The combination of dopexamine and norepinephrine could therefore constitute an interesting alternative in treating septic shock patients. This study will test the efficacy (on gastric mucosal blood flow, hepatic damage and oxidative stress) and safety of the combination of dopexamine and norepinephrine (compared to those of epinephrine alone) in the treatment of patients with septic shock.

ROS	Active, not recruiting	Brazilian Cardioprotective Nutritional Program Trial	Cardiovascular Diseases	Behavioral: BALANCE;   Behavioral: Cardioprotective diet	Hospital do Cora  o	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01620398?term=ROS&rank=920	NCT01620398	There are no studies exploring the benefits of a diet composed of typical Brazilian food in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Randomized studies show that the Mediterranean diet is beneficial for patients with established cardiovascular disease or in risk for CVD development. Indeed, nutritional composition of the Mediterranean Diet is one of main references for dietary guidelines for treatment and prevention of CVD in Brazil and the world. However, in many countries, such as Brazil, most foods of the Mediterranean diet are not widely available, may be expensive or are not part of population eating habits. So, the prescription of the Mediterranean diet intervention for cardiovascular disease to the Brazilian population may not be feasible, leading to a low adherence. In this context, patients with established CVD have a low compliance to nutritional prescription. The BALANCE Program, considers 3 concepts: a) A dietary prescription guided by nutritional content recommendations from the Brazilian national guidelines; b) A nutritional education program based on fun, playful strategies and suggestions of affordable foods; and c) Intensive follow-up through one-on-one visits, group sessions, and phone calls. This is the first proposal to use these concepts concurrently with the objective to increase adherence of secondary prevention patients to the diet proposed by the guidelines. Therefore, this trial will investigate the effects of the Program on reducing cardiovascular events - such as cardiac arrest, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke, myocardial revascularization, amputation for peripheral arterial disease, and hospitalization for unstable angina - or death in patients with established CVD. Moreover, it will evaluate the effects of the dietary program on reducing CV factors, such as BMI, waist circumference,	Brazil || Universidade Federal de Alagoas || Macei¨®, Alagoas, Brazil || Hospital Universit¨¢rio Professor Edgard Santos / ENUFBA / UFBA || Salvador, Bahia, Brazil || Hospital de Messejana || Fortaleza, Cear¨¢, Brazil || Universidade de Fortaleza || Fortaleza, Cear¨¢, Brazil || Hospital das Cl¨ªnicas de Goi nia || Goi nia, Goi¨¢s, Brazil, 90630000 || Hospital Universit¨¢rio Federal Presidente Dutra || S o Luiz, Maranh o, Brazil || Hospital Universit¨¢rio Maria Aparecida Pedrossian || Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil || Universidade Federal do Mato Grosso || Cuiab¨¢, Mato Grosso, Brazil || Universidade Federal de Vi osa || Vo osa, Minas Gerais, Brazil || Hospital Universit¨¢rio Alcides Carneiro || Campina Grande, Paraiba, Brazil || Hospital de Cl¨ªnicas da Universidade Federal do Paran¨¢ || Curitiba, Paran¨¢, Brazil || Hospital das Cl¨ªnicas Gaspar Viana || Bel¨¦m, Par¨¢, Brazil || Pronto Socorro Cardiol¨®gico Universit¨¢rio de Pernambuco || Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil || Hospital Universit¨¢rio Ana Bezerra || Santa Cruz, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil || URCAMP || Bag¨¦, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil || Hospital Universit¨¢rio AESC || Canoas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, 90630000 || BIOSERV || Passo Fundo, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, 90630000 || Universidade Federal de Pelotas || Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil || Hospital de Cl¨ªnicas de Porto Alegre || Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, 90630000 || Hospital Nossa Senhora da Concei  o || Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, 90630000 || Hospital S o Lucas da Pontif¨ªcia Universidade Cat¨®lica do Rio Grande do Sul || Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, 90630000 || Instituto de Cardiologia do Rio Grande do Sul || Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil || Associa  o Veranense de Assist¨ºncia em Sa¨²de (AVAES) || Veran¨®polis, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, 90630000 || Hospital Universit¨¢rio Pedro Ernesto || Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil || Universidade Vale do Itaja¨ª || Itaja¨ª, Santa Catarina, Brazil || Hospital S o Lucas || Aracaju, Sergipe, Brazil || Hospital Universit¨¢rio FUFSE || Aracaju, Sergipe, Brazil || Universidade Federal de Tocantins || Palmas, Tocantins, Brazil || Hospital Universit¨¢rio de Bras¨ªlia || Bras¨ªlia, Brazil || Hospital Universitario Pedro Ernesto || Rio de Janeiro, Brazil || Instituto Nacional de Cardiologia || Rio de Janeiro, Brazil || Hospital do Cora  o || S o Paulo, Brazil || Instituto Dante Pazzanese de Cardiologia || S o Paulo, Brazil || Universidade Federal de S o Paulo || S o Paulo, Brazil	[]	The Brazilian Cardioprotective Nutritional Program to Reduce Events and Risk Factors in Secondary Prevention for Cardiovascular Disease

Most knowledge about them comes from adult patients. Severe disease requires aggressive life-saving treatments with steroids and some cancer drugs which can themselves cause damage, and increase risks of cancer and severe infections. Conversely, milder disease can be treated with less toxic drugs. Different classification and "scoring tools" are used to define the types and severity of vasculitis and to measure damage caused by disease or drugs. These in turn help direct how aggressively to treat a patient and to measure outcome. None of these tools however have been assessed in children and the best balance of disease and treatment risks against outcome for children is not known. Although causes of these diseases in children and adults are probably the same, the effects of the disease and the response (good and bad) to drugs will differ in growing children. Because specialists may see only one new child with vasculitis each year, obtaining enough information to learn about childhood vasculitis requires cooperation. We will use an international web-based registry to which doctors from 50 or more centers can contribute patient data. We will determine the features which help better classify and diagnose children compared to adults. Through the web we will collect and analyze information on patients similarly classified and "scored" so that most successful treatments can be identified. Children with vasculitis are less likely to have diseases associated with aging, alcohol and smoking etc., and therefore may be a better group in whom to study the underlying biology of vasculitis. We will use this opportunity and collect spit, blood and tissue from registry patients for laboratory study with an aim to find biomarkers to better classify, define and direct optimal treatment and outcomes.

All patients presenting to one of the participating neurologists or general physicians within seven months of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) or TIA (eye or brain) are eligible for this trial. Eligible patients will be randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive multi-vitamins or placebo, 1 tablet daily. The primary outcome event is the composite event "stroke, myocardial infarction, or death from any vascular cause", whichever occurs first. Our target is to recruit a total of 8,000 patients over the next two years with a median follow-up of 2.5 years. Recruitment to the trial began in November 1998 and is planned to continue until December 2005. We aim to complete final follow-up by the end of 2006. However, the Steering Committee will be flexible in dictating the need for ongoing recruitment and continuing follow-up, depending on the overall rate of the primary outcome event in the entire cohort at each interim analysis.

However, one of the problems that interfere with fall prevention programs is the lack of importance accorded to health professionals to falls. This lack of awareness of the risks faced by the associated geriatric population falls generates reluctance to adherence to a fall prevention program . At European level there are the same gaps in knowledge about the real effectiveness and efficiency of fall prevention programs .  HYPOTHESIS: The implementation of a multicomponent fall prevention program in frail and pre-frail elderly community-dwelling people reduce the incidence of falls.  OBJECTIVES  General:    To determine the efficacy of a comprehensive program to prevent falls in the community.  Specific:      Knowing whether reducing the incidence of falls implies a reduction in visits to primary care, emergency department or hospital staying.    Knowing the adhesion, through indirect measures, to the intervention program.    Knowing the nutritional, functional, cognitive, social, anthropometric, respiratory and clinical profile, including falls, of the sample.    MATERIAL AND METHODS  Study design:  Multicenter community intervention study, longitudinal, prospective, randomized, and experimental.  Through intervention by nurses in primary care education of subjects over 70 years it is to know the effectiveness of a comprehensive program of falls prevention.  It will proceed to recruit older than or equal to 70 years subjects, who meet frailty criteria age, belonging to the areas of Madeira Island (Portugal) and La Ribera County (Val¨¦ncia, Spain) .

ROS	Unknown  	Observational Study of Cortical Spreading Depression in Human Brain Trauma				https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00803036?term=ROS&rank=932	NCT00803036	Since the primary damage from traumatic brain injury (TBI) is irreversible, the focus of medical management of TBI is preventing secondary injury that can be life-threatening and worsen patient outcome. Insight into the pathologic mechanisms of secondary injury, which are largely unknown, is required for developing better treatments.  In preliminary studies, the investigators have found that a pathologic brain activity, known as spreading depression, recurs in a large number of TBI patients in the first week after injury. Spreading depressions are short-circuits of brain function that arise spontaneously from an injury and spread repeatedly as waves into neighboring brain tissue. Animal research has shown that spreading depressions can cause secondary injury to the brain.  The primary objective of this observational study is to determine whether the occurrence or severity of spreading depression is related to worse neurologic recovery from TBI. Results from the study will determine whether monitoring of spreading depression should be used as a guide or target for improved medical management of the TBI patient.

The hypotheses in the present study of FSS and related conditions are: (1) FSS and related conditions are associated with higher rates of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), depression, and reduced quality of life than is observed in the general population; (2) persons close to an individual with FSS or related condition suffer similarly; and (3) current measures, which are single-disease specific (i.e., PTSS, depression, craniofacial deformities, or limb deformities), do not capture the unique picture of FSS and related conditions, which involve both limb and craniofacial deformities in an intellectually capable individual.  There have been no studies looking at quality of life associated with FSS. Some authors have looked at quality of life in persons with facial differences; other authors have looked at bone and joint problems. Many other authors have looked at PTSS and depression caused by health problems and bad medical experiences. No authors have looked at these problems when they happen together, as they do in FSS. Because of the above, there may be differences in patients that have FSS versus patients in previous quality of life studies. The study will also develop and validate an outcomes-based quality of life survey for FSS and related conditions.	United States, West Virginia || Freeman-Sheldon Research Group, Inc.

The use of arsenic trioxide was limited to relapsed patients mainly because of the superior efficacy of ATRA as primary therapy for newly diagnosed APML. Though the early study by Niu et al showed 72% remission rates in 11 newly diagnosed patients, the role of arsenic trioxide as primary therapy was limited by the hepatic toxicity seen in this study. Studies from our centre have shown remission rates of 70-75% in newly diagnosed patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. There was no major toxicity seen related to the administration of arsenic trioxide. Follow up data on these patients continue to show long term remission rates above 70%. These remission rates are similar to the data available in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia treated with ATRA. Lu et al studied 19 patients treated with oral arsenic (Tetra-arsenic tetra-sulfide) wherein 84% achieved hematological remission with disease free survival of 76% at 3 years. Studies from other groups using arsenic trioxide alone or in combination with ATRA have shown similar remission rates. Arsenic trioxide as primary therapy for patients with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia is a very attractive treatment option for developing countries mainly because of the low cost involved along with the favorable toxicity profile. However long term remission data is still not available and the ideal course and duration of treatment still needs to be defined. This multi-center study aims to further clarify the efficacy of this agent in the treatment of newly diagnosed cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia and to study the optimal maintenance regimen.

(PAH) Right ventricular ejection fraction is one of the most important predictors of prognosis in heart failure patients regardless of cause. It is estimated that 30-50% of patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) have right ventricular dysfunction and up to 70% of these patients will have significant pulmonary hypertension (PH), both of which are related to much worse prognosis. Right ventricular failure is becoming an increasingly prevalent and significant cause of morbidity in patients with left heart disease. Despite the significance of RV function to survival, there are no therapies available that directly or selectively improve RV function.  The overall theme of this research project is to evaluate the mechanisms that contribute to the cause of right heart failure. This small study is designed to look at the role of heart and lung metabolism and pulmonary hypertension as they relate to the development of right heart failure in cardiovascular disease.(PH-LHD)	Canada, Ontario || University of OttawaHeart Institute || Recruiting || Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, K1Y4W7 || Contact: Lisa M Mielniczuk, MD    613 761 4059 || lmielniczuk@ottawaheart.ca || Contact: Rosemary Dunne, RN    613 798 5555 ext 9295 || rdunne@ottawaheart.ca || Principal Investigator: Lisa M Mielniczuk, MD || Sub-Investigator: Duncan J Stewart, MD || Sub-Investigator: George Chandy, MD || Sub-Investigator: Vladimir Contreras, MD || Sub-Investigator: || Ross || Davies, MD || Sub-Investigator: Elena Pena, MD || Sub-Investigator: Carole Dennie, MD || Sub-Investigator: Rebecca Thornhill, PhD || Sub-Investigator: Rob Beanlands, MD || Sub-Investigator: Rob DeKemp, PhD	Contact: Lisa M Mielniczuk, MD || 613 761 4059 || lmielniczuk@ottawaheart.ca || Contact: Rosemary Dunne, RN || 613 798 5555 ext 9295 || rdunne@ottawaheart.ca	Evaluation of Cardiopulmonary Metabolism and Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Hypertension Associated With Left Heart Disease

ROS	Recruiting	Phase II Combination Steroid and Anti-VEGF for Persistent DME	Diabetic Macular Edema	Drug: intravitreal ranibizumab 0.3 mg;   Drug: dexamethasone intravitreal implant;   Procedure: Sham injection	                Phase 2              	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01945866?term=ROS&rank=949	NCT01945866	Although anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy is generally effective as treatment for center-involved diabetic macular edema (DME), a substantial proportion of anti-VEGF-treated eyes with DME do not achieve vision of 20/20 or complete resolution of retinal thickening. Indeed, over 50% of ranibizumab-treated eyes did not achieve a 2 or more line improvement in visual acuity from baseline at 2 years in Protocol I, a previous DRCR.net (Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network) study. Furthermore, 27% of ranibizumab-treated eyes still had central subfield (CSF) thickness on time-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) ¡Ý 300 at 1 year, and more than 40% of ranibizumab-treated eyes did not achieve complete resolution of retinal thickening (< 250 microns) by 2 years. Thus, there is a need for alternative or additional treatments that will improve vision by reducing retinal edema in eyes with persistent DME following previous anti-VEGF therapy. Intravitreal steroid is not as efficacious as ranibizumab in eyes with DME overall, but it has been shown to have a positive effect for DME in some eyes and might add benefit in eyes that are already receiving anti-VEGF.  The main objective of this study is to assess the short-term effects of combination steroid+anti-VEGF therapy on visual acuity and retinal thickness on OCT in comparison with that of continued anti-VEGF therapy alone in eyes with persistent central-involved DME and visual acuity impairment despite previous anti-VEGF treatment. This study will provide important information for the design of a future confirmatory phase III clinical trial on the efficacy of combination steroid and anti-VEGF in eyes with persistent DME and vision impairment following previous anti-VEGF therapy. The primary outcome for efficacy will be the mean change in visual acuity at 24 weeks.  Each study eye is required to complete a 12-week run-in phase. The run-in phase will identify study eyes that truly have persistent DME despite anti-VEGF therapy by requiring an additional 3 injections while also collecting standardized visual acuity and OCT measurements. At the enrollment, 4-week and 8-week visits of the run-in phase, enrolled eyes will receive an intravitreal injection of ranibizumab 3mg. Then at the 12-week run-in visit, if the eye still has persistent DME, it will be randomized to receive either intravitreal sham+intravitreal ranibizumab 0.3 or intravitreal dexamethasone+intravitreal ranibizumab 0.3 injections. The randomized study duration is 24 week, during which a protocol visit takes place every month. The combination injections of sham+ranibizumab or dexamethasone +ranibizumab will be given at the randomization visit (baseline) and at the 12-week visit after randomization. In between, an intravitreal injection of ranibizumab only will be given to study eyes at the 4, 8, 16 and 20 week visits.

In addition, these cohorts will be compared to patients who do not qualify for thymoglobulin and receive either an alternative agent or no agent. The primary endpoint is primary graft dysfunction. We will also evaluate several other early and late end points such as ventilator days, ICU/hospital days, acute/chronic rejection, infection, CT chest abnormalities, and survival.  We will also collect donor lung tissue and lavage fluid for measurement of various proteins and receptor expression at two time points: (1) prior to implementation and dosing of induction chemotherapy and (2) after transplantation (following a course of induction chemotherapy). This will allow us to possibly make a connection between the profiles of the various proteins and receptors and the clinical outcomes, depending on weather the patient has received induction chemotherapy, starting intraoperatively or postoperatively.

Afatinib dimaleate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. It is not yet known whether afatinib dimaleate is more effective when given alone or with cetuximab in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

Although radiation therapy to the pelvis has been a standard and important part of treatment for rectal cancer and has been shown to decrease the risk of the cancer coming back in the same area in the pelvis, some patients experience undesirable side effects from the radiation and there have been important advances in chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation which may be of benefit. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects, both good and bad, of the standard treatment of chemotherapy and radiation to chemotherapy using a combination regimen known as FOLFOX, (the drugs 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin and leucovorin) and selective use of the standard treatment, depending on response to the FOLFOX. The drugs in the FOLFOX regimen are all FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved and have been used routinely to treat patients with advanced colorectal cancer.

The cure of the H. pylori infection prevents recurrence of duodenal and gastric ulcer and improves dyspepsia in a significant proportion of cases, so it is cost-effective.  Eradication therapy has changed over time. The usually recommended pattern in the consensus conferences has traditionally been triple therapy, composed by the combination of 2 antibiotics (clarithromycin plus amoxicillin or metronidazole) and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for 7-14 days. Recent meta-analyses have that the current global eradication rate after standard triple therapy is less than 80%. Several European studies have found even lower eradication rates, with 35-40% of cases resulting in treatment failure. Treatment failure leads to a second treatment and a new diagnostic test to confirm eradication.	Spain || Hospital del Mar || Not yet recruiting || Barcelona, Spain || Contact: Javier P.

A minimum of 124 subjects (the number may be larger depending on the rate of subject dropout) with arm motor deficits 4-36 weeks after a stroke due to ischemia or to intracerebral hemorrhage will be randomized to receive 6 weeks of intensive arm motor therapy (a) in a traditional in-clinic setting or (b) via in-home telerehabilitation (rehabilitation services delivered to the subject's home via an internet-connected computer). The intensity, duration, and frequency of this therapy will be identical across the two groups, with subjects in both treatment arms receiving 36 sessions (18 supervised and 18 unsupervised), 80 minutes each (including a 10 minute break), over 6 weeks. The primary endpoint is within-subject change in the arm motor Fugl-Meyer (FM) score from the Baseline Visit to 30 Day Follow-Up Visit. Arm motor status is the focus here because it is commonly affected by stroke, is of central importance to many human functions, and is strongly linked to disability and well being after stroke.

Remission and low clinical activity not always imply absence of progression of structural damage. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the progression of radiological damage in early RA patients currently treated with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and low disease activity to which treatment with zoledronic acid is added.  The investigators propose a randomized clinical trial in 94 patients with RA of less than 2 years of evolution that, being treated with DMARDs, present criteria of low disease activity (DAS28 < 3.2).  Patients will be randomized into two branches: zoledronic acid and no treatment. The primary study endpoint is the progression of radiological damage assessed in a blinded way by the difference in the Sharp-van der Heijde index (SHI) in radiographs of hands and feet after two years; the secondary variables: radiographic progression after one year, serum bone biomarkers (OPG, RANKL, DKK-1 and sclerostin) and adverse effects. In a subgroup of patients, the investigators shall evaluate the change in the size of hand erosions by multislice computed tomography and the evolution of periarticular osteoporosis and systemic bone mass by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).

Glembatumumab vedotin consists of an antibody (a type of human protein) attached to a drug called Monomethyl Auristatin E (MMAE) that can kill cancer cells. Glembatumumab vedotin is intended to work by specifically directing the drug to the cancer cell. It attaches to a molecule on the cancer cell called gpNMB, and then releases the MMAE inside the tumor cell, which in turn causes the cell to die.  The purpose of this study is to see whether glembatumumab vedotin is effective in treating people who have advanced or metastatic squamous cell lung cancer that contains gpNMB, to examine how the body handles the drug and the side effects associated with glembatumumab vedotin.

The emotional and financial burden of AD to patients, family members, and society is enormous, and is predicted to grow exponentially as the median population age increases. Current FDA-approved therapies are modestly effective at best. This study will examine a novel therapeutic approach using intranasal insulin (INI) that has shown promise in short-term clinical trials. If successful, information gained from the study has the potential to move INI forward rapidly as a therapy for AD. The study will also provide evidence for the mechanisms through which INI may produce benefits by examining key cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and hippocampal/entorhinal atrophy. These results will have considerable clinical and scientific significance, and provide therapeutically-relevant knowledge about insulin's effects on AD pathophysiology. Growing evidence has shown that insulin carries out multiple functions in the brain, and that insulin dysregulation may contribute to AD pathogenesis.  This study will examine the effects of intranasally-administered insulin on cognition, entorhinal cortex and hippocampal atrophy, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or mild AD. It is hypothesized that after 12 months of treatment with INI compared to placebo, subjects will improve performance on a global measure of cognition, on a memory composite and on daily function. In addition to the examination of CSF biomarkers and hippocampal and entorhinal atrophy, the study aims to examine whether baseline AD biomarker profile, gender, or Apolipoprotein epsilon 4 (APOE-¦Å4) allele carriage predict treatment response.  In this study, 240 people with aMCI or AD will be given either INI or placebo for 12 months, following an open-label period of 6 months where all participants will be given active drug. The study uses insulin as a therapeutic agent and intranasal administration focusing on nose to brain transport as a mode of delivery.

ROS	Recruiting	OMEGA: Outcome Measures in Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal Disorders Across the Ages	Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal Disorders (EGIDs);   Eosinophilic Esophagitis;   Eosinophilic Gastritis;   Eosinophilic Colitis		jonathan.kuhl@cchmc.org	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02523118?term=ROS&rank=1004	NCT02523118	The purpose of this observational study is to find the best measures to define how well a person with eosinophilic disorder is doing. People with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), eosinophilic gastritis (EG), and eosinophilic colitis (EC) normally undergo endoscopy and/or colonoscopy (scope down the throat or up the bottom) where tissue specimens are collected for microscopic analysis. Treatments are then decided based on how the tissue looks. We are aiming to compare different tissue components such as inflammatory cell types with clinical symptoms. We want to see if scores on standard questionnaires can give us an idea how well the person is doing.

As opposed to testing an "off the shelf" vaccine that might be able to treat a subset of patients, our approach has been personalized to the patient and applicable to all patients. Our vaccine approach consists of harnessing the most potent antigen presenting cell in the body - the dendritic cell (DC) - together with the full repertoire of tumor antigens from an individual's cancer. We have conducted phase I and II studies using an autologous DC-tumor cell fusion technique that has now been simplified into a DC-tumor cell lysate vaccine. The autologous tumor lysate (TL) is loaded into yeast cell wall particles (YCWP) that are naturally and efficiently taken up into the patient's DC. These autologous tumor lysate, particle-loaded, DC (TLPLDC) are injected intradermally (ID) monthly x 3 followed by boosters at 6, 12, and 18 months.

ROS	Unknown  	Canadian e-Platform to Promote Behavioral Self-Management in Chronic Heart Failure: CHF-CePPORT	Heart Failure	Behavioral: eCounseling + Usual Care		https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01864369?term=ROS&rank=926	NCT01864369	Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) is a growing public health issue in Canada. Hospital re-admission within 1-year after diagnosis is 25-40%, and the 5-year rate of CHF death is 50%. Counseling by multidisciplinary health care teams helps CHF patients to improve self-care behaviors (for medications, diet, exercise, smoking cessation and symptom monitoring), and this reduces the rate of death and CHF hospitalization. In the absence of intervention, patient adherence to these behaviors is below recommended standards and quality of life among CHF patients becomes progressively compromised. A major challenge is to make self-care counseling available without overtaxing health care resources.  This 3.5 year multicenter clinical trial will establish and evaluate a Canadian e-platform that provides multidisciplinary e-counseling to help patients with CHF to initiate and maintain recommended self-care behaviors. The investigators will recruit 298 CHF patients in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. The investigators hypothesize that a 12-month program of e-Counseling + Usual Care versus general eInfo + Usual Care will improve quality of life, self-care behaviors and heart health. This proposal is based upon previous clinical trials in CHF, e-health and preventive lifestyle counseling by our team. It also builds upon our established collaboration with the consumer eHealth program of the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario. The novel contribution of this research is that it will establish an infrastructure for a pan-Canadian e-platform in preventive e-counseling for CHF. A key feature of this proposal is that our multidisciplinary team will work with the Heart and Stroke Foundation to share our findings and e-health resources with the public and other health care professionals in Canada, which will help to galvanize research and clinical work in eCounseling. Our clinical trial will strengthen eCounseling services in order to improve the quality of life of patients with CHF.

The CRT pacemaker being studied in this clinical trial is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients with moderate to severe heart failure, whose hearts pump blood inefficiently. In the MIRACLE EF study, patients who have heart failure with slightly less inefficient hearts will be observed to see if the electrical pacing treatment is better than not getting the treatment. This study is being conducted to support FDA approval of this type of pacemaker for people whose heart failure is less inefficient.	[]	[]	MIRACLE EF Clinical Study

Eyes that have central-involved DME with "good" visual acuity (20/25 or better) have not been addressed systematically by recent studies for treatment of DME. Baseline cohort characteristics from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) suggest that a substantial percentage of eyes with central-involved DME may retain good vision. The investigators do not know definitively whether eyes with central-involved DME and good vision do better with anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) (e.g. aflibercept) therapy initially, or focal/grid laser treatment or observation initially followed by anti-VEGF only if vision worsens.  The primary objective of the protocol is to compare the % of eyes that have lost at least 5 letters of visual acuity at 2 years compared with baseline mean visual acuity in eyes with central-involved DME and good visual acuity defined as a Snellen equivalent of 20/25 or better (electronic-ETDRS letter score of 79 or better) that receive (1) prompt focal/grid photocoagulation + deferred anti-VEGF, (2) observation + deferred anti-VEGF, or (3) prompt anti-VEGF.  Secondary objectives include:      Comparing other visual acuity outcomes between treatment groups, such as the percent of eyes with at least 5, 10 and 15 letter losses in visual acuity from baseline mean visual acuity, percent of eyes with at least 5 letter gain in visual acuity from baseline, mean visual acuity, mean change in visual acuity, adjusted for baseline mean visual acuity    For eyes randomized to deferred anti-VEGF, the percentage of eyes needing anti-VEGF treatment    Comparing optical coherence tomography (OCT) outcomes, such as the mean change in OCT central subfield (CSF) thickness, adjusted for baseline mean thickness    Comparing the number of eyes with PDR at randomization, proportion of eyes avoiding vitreous hemorrhage or panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) or vitrectomy for PDR between treatment groups    Comparing safety outcomes between treatment groups    Comparing associated treatment and follow-up exam costs between treatment groups  	[]	[]	Treatment for Central-Involved Diabetic Macular Edema in Eyes With Very Good Visual Acuity

The proposed research will test whether phosphodiesterase 5A inhibition could become a new target for antiremodeling drugs and to discover molecular pathways affected by this class of drugs and a network of circulating markers (miRNA) for the early diagnosis of acromegaly cardiomyopathy.  We hypothesize that:      the signal molecules cGMP and cAMP could underlie the hypertrophic/profibrotic triggers related to this model of endocrine cardiomyopathy and that chronic inhibition of PDE5, activating cGMP signaling pathways, could improve cardiac remodeling due to acromegaly    PDE5 inhibition could have a role in lipolytic regulation;    neuroendocrine (e.g. natriuretic peptides) and metabolic markers and chemokines (e.g. MCP-1, TGF- ) might relate with left ventricular (LV) remodeling in Acromegaly;    there are neuroendocrine (e.g. natriuretic peptides), metabolic markers and chemokines (e.g. MCP-1, TGF- ) related to cardiac disease in Acromegaly;    miRNA expression [miR-208a, 499, 1, 133, 126, 29, 233, 222, 4454] might relate with LV remodeling in Acromegaly.

However, pain modulation hypotheses in TMD are still lacking.  The periaqueductal gray (PAG) is involved in the descending modulation of defensive behavior and pain through ¦Ì, ¦Ê, and ¦Ä opioid receptors. Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) has been extensively used for pain relief, as low-frequency stimulation is able to activate   receptors. The aim of the present study is to use ANS polygraph and salivary/serum biomarkers to evaluate the effect of low-frequency TENS stimulation of ANS in TMD patients.  According to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD, people with myogenous TMD and matched-controls will be enrolled. All subjects will be randomly assigned to control group (no tens stimulation) and case group (test stimulation); subsequently, ANS parameters by both biomarkers and ANS polygraph, before, soon after (end of stimulation), and late after (recovery period) sensorial TENS will be collected.  The overall statistics will be performed from all conditions recorded comparing controls vs cases.  The expected results consist in discovering ANS deregulation in TMD with and without TENS stimulation.

Moreover, research has shown that unrelieved CP and the lack of available expertise contribute to emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions. At The Ottawa Hospital (TOH), close to 18,000 ED visits per year are related to CP (12.9%). Among high frequency visitors (HFV; >= 8 visits per year), a small number of patients with CP use an inordinate amount of acute care resources. The investigators study will use a randomized controlled (RCT) design to conduct a pilot evaluation of the impact of a Complex Interdisciplinary Pain Assessment Program (CIPAP) linked with primary care physicians (PCP) compared to a treatment as usual (TAU) control arm.  The investigators hypothesis is that implementing a CIPAP will increase health care value through improved patient outcomes and reduced costs in HFV with chronic pain (CP-HFV). The investigators believe that a CIPAP will provide CP-HFV patients long-term pain management solutions, ED visits for CP will be reduced, and hospital admissions for CP will be prevented. This pilot RCT study will inform a larger-scale RCT study to be conducted in the future.

ROS	Completed	Evaluating Sequential Strategies to Reduce Readmission in a Diverse Population	Hospital Readmission;   Post-discharge Care Transitions;   Congestive Heart Failure;   Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	Other: Patient Navigator;   Other: Usual care	Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01619098?term=ROS&rank=781	NCT01619098	Hospital readmissions are common, costly, and potentially preventable. They are also potentially responsive to health system interventions. However, it is uncertain which components of care transition interventions are efficacious, for which populations, and at what cost. This randomized controlled study is part of a larger project that will evaluate a three-tiered quality improvement (QI) intervention intended to reduce hospital readmissions within 30 days post-discharge from an urban safety net hospital that serves a racially and linguistically diverse population (the randomized controlled study evaluates Tier 3). Few studies have evaluated care transition interventions to reduce readmissions among low-income, diverse patient populations, and the accumulated evidence on the effects of these multi-faceted interventions on readmission rates has been inconclusive. This project will take advantage of a unique sequence of three QI innovations to reduce hospital readmissions implemented beginning in 2007 in an integrated safety net health care system. The "discharge-transfer" tiers are as follows: 1) Tier 1 includes a comprehensive, individualized home care plan (HCP) reviewed by the medical service floor nurse with the patient prior to discharge; 2) Tier 2 adds the electronic transmission of the HCP to the patient's primary care medical home where, on the business day following discharge, a Registered Nurse makes an outreach telephone call to the discharged patient to confirm comprehension of the HCP and to address medical questions or needs; 3) Tier 3 further adds a community health worker, the Patient Navigator, to participate in bedside discussions to develop rapport and learn about patients' home situations, weekly outreach calls to assess patients' needs and to facilitate communication between the patient and the primary care team, and reminder calls to patients prior to all medical appointments to eliminate barriers to outpatient follow-up. The Aim of the study being registered is to evaluate the effects of an ongoing randomized natural experiment on readmissions, health care use, adherence to medication instructions, and preparedness for discharge. This natural experiment features random assignment to one of two QI interventions, Tier 2 or Tier 3, and exclusively targets patients at high risk for readmission, those with one or more of the following risk factors for readmission: discharge diagnosis of congestive heart failure or COPD; length of stay > 3 days; age > 60; or previous hospitalization within the past six months.  The investigators hypothesize that the Patient Navigator intervention (Tier 3) compared to usual care (Tier 2) will increase the rates of 30-day post-discharge PCP visits; reduce 30-day hospital readmission rates; and reduce the total number of days in hospital in the 180 days following the index admission for high risk patients. The investigators further expect that the PN intervention will improve patient adherence to medication instructions in the HCP and reduce the probability of reported problems with post-discharge care.

ROS	Completed	Testing for the Presence of Authorship Bias in Peer Review	Peer Review	Other: Blinded manuscript;   Other: Unblinded manuscript		https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02739737?term=ROS&rank=746	NCT02739737	No consensus exists among biomedical journals on the subject of blinding during the peer review process. Some journals attempt to remove all identifiers of authorship from potential manuscripts before delivering to referees for peer review while others prefer to leave the authorship transparent. Although peer review remains the gold standard for manuscript evaluation, the lack of a standardized blinding process between editorial offices may be a source of publication bias and make comparisons of manuscripts published in different journals more difficult to interpret.  Proponents of a blinded peer review system believe that knowledge of authorship may leave referees vulnerable to biases about those authors' previous research, perceived expertise, institution, nationality, or gender. This shifts judgment away from the merits of the scientific work and introduces pre-conceived notions about the identity and background of the author into the review process. Conversely, supporters of transparent authorship argue that knowledge of author identity makes it easier for the referee to provide more appropriate critiques. Open author identification allows referees to compare the current manuscript to previously published work by the author, and to recognize or identify potentially important conflicts of interest.  The investigators therefore propose an experimental study to address the question of whether blinding affects the likelihood a reviewer will recommend acceptance of a study being peer reviewed. The investigators plan to work in partnership with a journal to have a fabricated manuscript peer reviewed by a large number of reviewers; the authors will send this "test" manuscript out either in blinded form (authors' names/institutions not shown to reviewers) or in open form, with the names of several well-known, well-regarded authors and their institutions visible to peer reviewers. The manuscripts will otherwise be identical.  The partnering journal, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research allows both open and blinded peer review, regularly employing both approaches (authors can choose what kind of review they prefer when they submit to CORR), and so the reviewers are unlikely to be troubled by seeing a manuscript in either format.  The primary goal of this study is to determine whether the identification of a manuscript with a prominent group of authors (open authorship) will affect the likelihood that reviewers will recommend the manuscript for publication.  Additionally, the investigators plan to purposely place several errors in the manuscript, and tally how often reviewers detect these mistakes, to determine whether reviewers read the work of prominent authors less critically.  The investigators will also compare the reviewers' grading of the (identical) methods section, to determine whether the identification of a manuscript with prominent authors results in higher reviewer grades for methodological rigor.  This study tests the following specific hypotheses:      The visibility of prominent author names and institutions on test manuscripts will be associated with increased likelihood that the manuscript will be recommended for publication by peer reviewers. (Primary Study Endpoint)    The visibility of prominent author names and institutions will be associated with a decreased likelihood that purposefully placed "errors" in the experimental manuscript will be detected by the reviewers.    The visibility of prominent author names and institutions will be associated with increased scores given by reviewers for the methods section, despite the fact that the methods sections of the experimental manuscript will be identical.    NOTE:  All elements of the research protocol were approved by the University of Washington Human Subjects Review Committee, including the study's opt-out design for reviewer recruitment, since it was considered important that reviewers not know that the paper they evaluated was part of a study. To minimize the potential for harm, the authors chose as the topic of the fabricated test manuscript an intervention that could not be immediately put into practice at reviewers' own centers (a particular team-training process in the operating room). In addition, participating reviewers were informed which paper was the test manuscript at the completion of data collection, so that they did not pursue this sort of team training based on the results of the fabricated study.  To reduce the risk of an observer (Hawthorne) effect, it was important to minimize the likelihood that participant reviewers would learn of the study while it was in progress. To this end, the investigators elected not to pre-register the study in a trial registry.	[]	[]	Testing for the Presence of Authorship Bias in Peer Review

The investigators have previously shown that the intake of one HFHC meal leads to an increase in oxidative stress and inflammation. HFHC meal also induces an increase in the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling- 3 (SOCS-3) in the mononuclear cells (MNC), which interferes with insulin signal transduction and contributes to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. In contrast, an American heart association (AHA) meal rich in fruits and fiber does not induce these effects. These observations are important since HFHC meal not only induces oxidative stress and inflammation but also lays the foundations of a potentially greater insulin resistance through the induction of SOCS-3, TLR-4 and TLR-2.

ROS	Suspended	Treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) With N-acetylcysteine	Systemic Lupus Erythematosus	Drug: N-acetylcysteine;   Drug: Placebo	                Phase 1                Phase 2              	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00775476?term=ROS&rank=745	NCT00775476	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory disease which often has debilitating and potentially life-threatening consequences. The cause of SLE is unknown and current therapies lack specificity and carry significant side-effects. Existing data in the literature provide evidence that a natural antioxidant, glutathione, is depleted in T cells of patients with SLE. This may be a key factor underlying abnormal activation and predisposition of T lymphocytes to pro-inflammatory cell death via necrosis. Administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), that serves as a precursor of glutathione (GSH), improves the clinical outcome of murine lupus, and limits the toxicity of pro-oxidant/immunosuppressant medications commonly used in patients with SLE. NAC is widely available in health food stores and large doses (up to 8 g/day) can be safely administered to humans. In a one-year study of patients with inflammatory lung disease treated with prednisone and azathioprine, addition of NAC (1.8 g/day) diminished disease severity and reduced drug toxicity in comparison to placebo. Moreover, oral NAC has been found to improve muscle fatigue which is reported to be the most disabling symptom in 53% of patients with SLE. Thus, establishing a dose ranging between 1.2-7.2 g/day that is well tolerated and capable of raising intracellular GSH in lupus patients and determining its immunological and therapeutic impact in SLE appears to be well justified.  The study will consist of two parts, Aim 1 and Aim 2.  AIM 1:  The purpose of Aim 1 was to establish the optimal daily oral dose of NAC that can be well tolerated without side effects and can normalize or moderate the depletion of GSH in lupus T cells.  36 SLE subjects and 42 healthy controls (matched by age and sex) were studied.  The 36 SLE subjects were divided into 3 groups of 12. Each group received a different dose of NAC (N-acetylcysteine)or placebo as follows:  Group 1: 9 received 600mg of NAC two times a Day, 3 received placebo; Group 2: 9 received 1200mg of NAC two times a Day, 3 received placebo; Group 3: 9 received 2400mg of NAC two times a Day, 3 received placebo;  To account for attrition 12 subjects were randomized in each group (9 active, 3 placebo).  At each subject visit, blood from a healthy donor was drawn and used as control. The control blood was used for flow cytometry measurements of GSH and in vitro immunological studies. In addition to GSH measurements and immunologic studies, routine labs., ASRS self-reporting assessment questionnaire, and SLEDAI/BILAG/Fatigue scores were obtained for the SLE subjects. The healthy control subjects also answered the ASRS self-reporting questionnaire. The ASRS questionnaire was incorporated into the study procedures in October, 2009. It is designed to assess a patient's ability to concentrate which could be affected by the involvement of the Central Nervous System (CNS) in lupus. There were up to 5 study visits per SLE subjects in a period of four months.  At each visit up to 100 ml of blood were drawn from each subject. 20 ml are needed for routine labs. and up to 80 ml are needed for the GSH and immunological tests.  Dose comparisons were based on continuous monitoring of adverse events and drug tolerance.  AIM 2:  Aim 2 will determine the tolerance and impact of two NAC doses on disease activity and prednisone use in 165 subjects with SLE in a double-blind placebo-controlled 12-month study. It is designed to detect clinically meaningful differences in disease activity in the patient population.  It was determined by statistical analysis that each group must have 55 subjects. SLE subjects will be randomized into 3 groups of 55 subjects to receive 1.2 g of NAC twice a day, 2.4 g of NAC twice a day, or placebo. There will be up to seven study visits per SLE subject, including the screening and wash out visits. Visits 1-5 will be scheduled three months apart. The study will last 13 months with the wash out visit. Each subject will donate approximately 80 ml of blood for research at each visit. Healthy control subjects will donate blood at the same time. They will be matched to the SLE subjects by gender, age within 10 years, and ethnicity. Their blood will be used as reference for research assays.  The inclusion and exclusion criteria will be the same as in Aim 1 and the same subjects may continue to participate. There is a new consent form required to participate in the second phase.

A third of these cannot be saved before treatment is possible.  Despite quick and effective reperfusion of the coronary arteries using PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) after an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction, substantial morbidity and mortality remain. Infarct size is an important determinant of the short-and long-term outcome after acute myocardial infarction. The most widely used and most effective proven therapy to limit infarct size is the early reperfusion induced by or PCI.  Although beneficial in terms of myocardial salvage, reperfusion itself may contribute to additional damage of the myocardium; the damage due to the combined processes is known as "ischemia-reperfusion injury". The pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury is a multifactorial process involving the interaction of multiple mechanisms. Numerous studies indicate that there are three pivotal factors in the pathogenesis of ischemia-reperfusion injury: elevated oxidative damage, depressed energy metabolism, and altered calcium homeostasis.  Partially reduced species of oxygen, including the superoxide anion radical, hydroxyl radical, and hydrogen peroxide, are generated intracellularly as by-product of oxygen metabolism. These reactive oxygen species cause peroxidation af membrane lipids, denaturation of proteins, and modification of DNA, all of which ultimately can lead to cell death. In mammals, cell damage induced by partially reduced oxygen species can also initiate local inflammatory responses, which then lead to further oxidant-mediated tissue injury.  Melatonin is mainly known for its role as an endogenously produced circadian hormone.  For the last twenty years, increasing evidence has proven melatonin to be a very potent direct and indirect antioxidant.  Recent experimental studies have documented the beneficial effects of melatonin in reducing tissue damage and limiting cardiac pathophysiology in models of experimental ischemia-reperfusion.  Primary hypothesis: Melatonin given to patients undergoing PCI can reduce the myocardial damage sustained by ischemia-reperfusion.

ROS	Unknown  	The Effect of Ulinastatin on Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid of Inflammatory Factors in Patients With Ventilator-associated Pneumonia	Ventilator-associated Bacterial Pneumonia;   Mechanical Ventilation Complication	Drug: Ulinaststin for injection;   Drug: placebo	                Phase 2                Phase 3              doctorlcy@sina.com	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01865266?term=ROS&rank=701	NCT01865266	Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in ventilated critically ill patients specially in intensive care unit (ICU). It is associated with an increased duration of mechanical ventilation, high death rates and increased healthcare costs in the development country.  Although VAP is preventable and many practices have been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of this disease, the morbidity is still so high. VAP is hard to cure and the mortality is about to 40% which was reported in China in 2004. If the bacteria of multidrug-resistance(MDR) is isolated, the mortality can increase to 70%. So much more methods should be needed in treating VAP in addition to using antibiotics.  Ulinastatin is a serine protease inhibitor with a molecular weight of 67,000 found in healthy human urine. It is used worldwide for patients with inflammatory disorders, including disseminated intravascular coagulation(DIC),shock, and pancreatitis . Furthermore, ulinastatin administration can help reduce sepsis, prevent multiple organ dysfunction, and modulate immune functions.  Actually, three studies have showed that ulinastatin treatment is associated with reduced the levels of inflammatory factors in blood serum in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS).Though analyses of serum inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-¦Á and interleukin (IL)-6 have been used to determine the degree of systemic inflammation under various clinical conditions, they can not reflect the degrees of lung infection directly.  Basing on the results of previous studies, meta analyses and system reviews, the investigators hypothesized that the anti-inflammatory function of ulinaststin may also decrease the levels of inflammatory factors in bronchoalveolar lavage(BAL) fluid in Patients with VAP.  In addition there is no prospective study to investigate the role of ulinastatin in BAL. The investigator hopes that this study can approve the relationship between ulinastatin and inflammatory factors in BAL. And it can improve the processes,outcomes and costs of critical care as well.

In the past it has been a disease of the elderly patient but as a consequence of recreational sun exposure and tanning beds, more young patients develop a skin cancer as well. There are different subtypes of BCC and most subtypes are treated by surgical excision. Nowadays, non-invasive techniques as photodynamic therapy (PDT) are common practice to treat superficial BCC (sBCC). Because of these techniques treatment by surgical excision can be avoided with the possibility of complications and scar formation. Both 5-aminolevulino acid (5-ALA) and the more lipophilic methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) can be used as a precursor of the photosensitiser. These agents generate an excess of protoporphyrin IX in metabolic active cells, which are illuminated by a specific light source leading to release of reactive oxygen radicals in tissue. The result is apoptosis and necrosis of tumour cells. At the moment, two treatment protocols are used in the Netherlands: the fractionated 5-ALA 20% (Fagron) protocol according to de Haas and the MAL (Metvix, Galderma) protocol. Because MAL was first marketed and registered as a treatment option for premalignant and superficial malignancies most hospitals in the Netherlands use this topical agent. However, there is no evidence which of the 2 agents is more (cost-)effective and/ or preferred by patients.  Objective: to determine which treatment is the most effective treatment in terms of prevention of treatment failure, cost saving and patients preference when comparing fractionated 5-ALA 20% PDT versus MAL PDT in 2 treatment sessions.

ROS	Completed	Metvix PDT in Patients With "High Risk" Basal Cell Carcinoma	Basal Cell Carcinoma	Procedure: Photodynamic therapy with Metvix 160 mg/g cream	                Phase 3              	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00473343?term=ROS&rank=683	NCT00473343	Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is the selective destruction of abnormal cells through light activation of a photosensitiser in the presence of oxygen. These cells accumulate more photosensitiser than normal cells. The photosensitiser generates reactive oxygen species upon illumination.  For skin diseases, there has been an increasing interest in using precursors of the endogenous photoactive porphyrins. The most commonly used precursors have been 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and its derivatives. The present test drug, Metvix , contains the methyl ester of ALA, which penetrates the lesions well and shows high lesion selectivity .  BCC is a highly frequent skin malignancy, and accounts for approximately 75% of all non-melanoma skin cancers . It is the most common cancer in humans . Several non-pharmacological treatment modalities are used for BCC, including excision surgery, curettage and electrodesiccation, cryosurgery and more advanced modalities like radiation therapy, plastic surgery with reconstruction and Moh's surgery. The treatment used depends on the type, size, depth and localisation of the BCC lesion. Treatment options for BCC give good response rates in the majority of patients but are inadequate in a small group of patients defined as "high-risk" BCC.  In this particular patient group, even a moderate complete response rate with good cosmetic results may be considered beneficial, since the number of patients who have to receive more advanced therapy with the possibility of high morbidity and poor cosmetic outcome will be reduced. Even a partial response is of clinical interest since the remaining tumour will require less extensive surgery. In the case of treatment failure, Metvix PDT does not interfere with the use of other treatment modalities.  The variable "complete response" after one or two Metvix treatment cycles will be used as the basis for the justification of sample size. The following hypothesis will be tested:  H0: Complete response rate of Metvix is less or equal to 65 % versus the alternative hypothesis HA: Complete response rate of Metvix is greater than 65 %	Australia, New South Wales || Department of Dermatology, St. George Hospital || Kogarah, New South Wales, Australia, NSW 2217 || Australia, Queensland || South East Dermatology, The Belmont Specialist Clinic || Carnia, Queensland, Australia, 4152 || Australia, South Australia || Department of Dermatology, Royal Adelaide Hospital || Adelaide, South Australia, Australia, SA 5000 || Dermatology Department, The Queen Elisabeth Hospital || Adelaide, South Australia, Australia, SA 5011 || Australia, Victoria || Clinic B, Repatriation Campus, Austin & Repatriation Medical Centre || Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia, VIC 3081 || Australia, Western Australia || Fremantle Dermatology || Fremantle, Western Australia, Australia, WA 6106 || Dermatology Surgery & Laser Centre, The Perth Surgicentre || Perth, Western Australia, Australia, WA 6151	[]	An Open Multicenter, Phase III Study of Photodynamic Therapy With Metvix Cream 160 mg/g in Patients With "High Risk" Basal Cell Carcinoma

To establish a prospective collection of clinic pathological information from NSCLC patients with corresponding blood and tissue samples    To discover and validate molecular biomarkers of survival and treatment outcome in NSCLC    One of the current difficulties in the management of lung cancer is the decision to treat and the type of treatment to select. Thus there is a need for additional prognostic (indicative of disease aggressiveness) and predictive (indicative of likely response to treatment) markers for lung cancer. To conduct a successful prognostic and predictive marker program, several factors are required, including: a comprehensive database linking clinical, histopathological, treatment and outcome characteristics of each case, a collection of samples linked to the database that is suitable for the testing of candidate markers, and a multi-disciplinary, interdepartmental level of expertise in the management of lung cancer.  Objective 1:  A review of the case records will be conducted to extract clinical, treatment and follow-up data  Objective 2:  Patients aged 21 years or more with newly diagnosed, untreated non-small cell lung cancer shall be approached for consent. Patients will be identified through the pathology records, and from the study investigators' clinic. After subject consent, baseline characteristics will be obtained. Follow up data on therapies received and toxicities encountered will be obtained. Tumor samples will be obtained only from patients with NSCLC undergoing surgery as part of routine clinical care. The surgical specimen will be sent to Pathology to verify the adequacy of the diagnostic sample as per usual practice. Blood will be collected at the baseline (or prior to any anti-cancer treatment) and will be sampled again at the time of relapse or disease progression. Collection will entail drawing 7ml blood into a Vacutainer CPT tube (Becton Dickinson, USA), centrifugation, extraction of a separated layer of mononuclear cells (MNC), labeling followed by storage below -80oC. The frequency of blood drawn will be about 1-5 times (7-35mls total). The number of times depends on whether the lung cancer relapses and in the advanced stage, how often the lung cancer relapses after treatment. DNA and RNA will be extracted by CSIS and stored in freezer space there. Stored samples will be used for investigation of prognostic and predictive markers of outcome and for discovery of novel molecular alterations  Objective 3:  Biomarker analysis of tumor and blood. Blood will be enriched for circulating tumor cells (CTC) using previously optimized methods (11) and DNA will be extracted from CTC and tumor using the Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinatti, OH). DNA will be extracted from tumor, CTC and mononucleated cells and tested for somatic lung mutations by sequencing (2). Germline DNA will be analysed for genes linked to genetic risk for NSCLC and, for treatment toxicities, for genes related to NSCLC chemotherapy metabolic pathways.  Tissue microarray (TMA) is a high-throughput method of analysing large numbers of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor at a minimal cost and effort. To analyse the expression of proteins of putative relevance to EGFR function, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, apoptosis, metastasis, and hormonal, TMA will be utilised. PTEN and C/EBPa will also be analysed.

Culture media systems have been developed that support each step of this process. Although these culture media systems try to mimic the natural environment, several components of the in-vivo situation are not present in today s media. One such component is anti-oxidants that may protect embryos against damage by reactive oxygen species.  This investigation aims to compare blastocyst development using 2 different types of culture media systems, one of which contains antioxidants. Patients having at least eight oocytes and meeting other inclusion criteria can be included in this investigation.  It is a prospective randomized multicenter study randomly dividing oocytes into two groups and assessing parameters of embryo development from fertilization up to blastocyst formation until day six. Embryos with acceptable developmental characteristics can be transferred into the uterus or cryopreserved for later use.  The investigation is designed as a superiority study comparing utilization rate of blastocysts per normally fertilized oocyte using both media systems. In patients receiving embryo transfer in the fresh treatment cycle, detection of clinical pregnancy by ultrasound after 12 weeks gestation is the final endpoint of the investigation.

Hypertension, proteinuria and edema are the most common and well-known maternal clinical symptoms. The incidence is approximately 6-8%. Pre-eclampsia is one of the leading causes of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity associated with pregnancy throughout the world. The pathophysiology is unknown. At present, the most effective treatment is immediate delivery.  The researchers' studies contributed to the demonstration that the vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) is important for correct placentation and that less nitric oxide (NO)- dependent vasodilation and an excess formation of reactive oxygen species explain poor placenta perfusion in pre-eclampsia. This reduced NO activity and increased oxidative stress in pre-eclamptic placenta is related to low bioavailability of L-arginine, the NO precursor.  In this pilot study the researchers want to evaluate whether the administration of L-arginine to women with a clinical diagnosis of preeclampsia might restore physiological NO production in the placenta and ameliorate the pregnancy outcome.

ROS	Terminated	Macular Pigment Optical Density in Healthy Subjects	Age Related Macular Degeneration			https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00993330?term=ROS&rank=644	NCT00993330	The macular pigment (MP) in humans consists of the yellow, blue-absorbing carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin, which are contained in vegetables and fruits. The highest concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin are found in the fovea. Since light entering the eye passes through the MP before reaching the photo receptors it absorbs a significant portion of short-wavelength light. There is evidence that these absorbing properties of the MP as well as the ability of inactivating highly reactive oxygen species are protective for the retina.  Measurement of macular pigment is difficult and the investigators have recently proposed a way of measuring macular pigment optical density (MPOD) based on optical reflectometry. There is increased interest in these measurements in the recent years, because a number of studies has provided evidence that low fruit and vegetable consumption increases the risk of age related macular degeneration (AMD). The present study investigates MP optical density (OD) in healthy volunteers and is used to form a database.  Furthermore the nutritional habits and the influence on MP density will be evaluated.

While there is anecdotal evidence to support this intervention, preliminary results in healthy children showed no differences in graphical quality while drawing on vertical or horizontal surfaces. This however was not investigated in children with graphomotor impairments.  The goal of this study is to determine whether movements produced on a vertical surface differ in their performance level and muscle activation patterns compared to movements produced on a horizontal surface. The investigators predict that the level of performance on the vertical surface will exceed the level of performance on the horizontal surface. Additionally, the investigators hypothesize that the proximal muscles will be more activated and fatigued (in longer tasks) while drawing on the vertical surface, while the distal muscle will be more activated and fatigued while drawing on the horizontal surface.

ROS	Completed	Comparison of Oxidative Stress and Insulin Resistance Before and After Using Physioneal in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients	Kidney Failure,Chronic	Drug: Physioneal		https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00172211?term=ROS&rank=624	NCT00172211	Patients affected by end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are subjected to enhanced oxidative stress, as a result of reduced anti-oxidant systems and increased pro-oxidant activity. Besides, insulin resistance is also very common in ESRD patients. Both enhanced oxidative stress and insulin resistance increase the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular mortality, and intention to reduce oxidative stress and insulin resistance is important in ESRD patients who suffer from high cardiovascular risk.  The high concentration of glucose and glucose degradation products (GDP), high lactate, and low pH in conventional peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions are known as bioincompatible factors, which are believed to increase oxidative stress in PD patients. Physioneal , a more biocompatible dialysis solution with neutral pH, physiologic bicarbonate concentration and low GDP level, has been applied in Europe for several years. Previous studies of Physioneal  have revealed advantages of improved infusion pain, more efficient acid-base control, increased ultrafiltration, and reduced peritonitis duration. However, its effects on oxidative stress and insulin resistance in peritoneal dialysis patients are not reported yet. The comparison of oxidative stress and insulin resistance before and after using Physioneal  may help to elucidate the possibly beneficial effects on uremic patients, which frequently suffer from increased oxidative stress and insulin resistance.  Thirty continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients will be selected in this study, and receive conventional solution (Dianeal  PD-2 or PD-4) for a baseline period of 3 months. Then Physioneal  will be used for 3 months. Clinical conditions, biochemical and hematological parameters, oxidative markers in blood and effluent, and insulin resistance will be measured at baseline, before and after Physioneal , and some markers will be measured 1 month after discontinuing Physioneal  and changing back to conventional solution. The medication used in each patient will be recorded, and the dialysis prescription will be adjusted by a nephrologist according to clinical data. The data collected before and after Physioneal  will be analyzed by paired-t test.

Postprandial hypertriglyceridemia increases the oxidation of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and increases blood concentrations of several biomarkers of in ammation. This postprandial lipemia-induced oxidative stress mediated response to a high-fat meal has been suggested as a major contributor to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis along with other chronic disease states of diabetes and obesity. Consumption of foods rich in antioxidant compounds provides a defence source to compliment endogenous defence systems to protect against oxidative damage during pro-oxidant conditions.  The hypothesis of the study is that tomato extracted lycopene will be able to decrease postprandial oxidation and in ammation in healthy weight men and women when compared to Placebo.

Overtraining is often caused by the bodies' lack of ability to recover between training. In addition, during high intensity training reactive oxygen species are formed up to 20 fold compared to resting values. This causes increased muscle tissue damage after intense exercise, which slows down recovery. Improving recovery may increase an athlete's ability to reach higher training volumes resulting in establishing a higher performance plateau.  It is known that hydrolyzed proteins have a positive effect on muscle protein synthesis due to its faster absorption rate. Therefore, it is hypothesized that a known protein hydrolysate may have positive effects on strength recovery.	[]	[]	The Effect of a Protein Hydrolysate on Muscle Strength Recovery in Athletes

Anti-VEGF agents the VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, and the small molecule VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Angiogenic factors play a key role in the maintenance of lung integrity and normal endothelial function. Endothelial dysfunction has been implicated in hypertension, proteinuria and retinopathy. One of the major issues of anti-VEGF agents is its long-term toxicity especially taking into account the lack of adequate knowledge in this area and the possibility of prolonged periods of therapy in non-progressing patients. Hypertension and proteinuria are commonly seen in patients treated with anti-VEGF agents. In addition, the investigators have also observed in a relatively high frequency of pulmonary air-filled lesions in patients with malignancy in the lung treated with an anti-VEGF agent. Objectives of this exploratory study are to 1) determine the effect of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on endothelial function 2) determine endothelial dysfunction as a marker of early response and as an indicator for the development of hypertension and proteinuria 3) characterize the effect of anti-VEGF therapy on the pulmonary function of patients with malignancy (primary or secondary) involving the lung in patients treated with anti-VEGF agents. Pharmacodynamic endpoints to be assessed are: blood pressure, brachial artery reactivity, retinal microvessels, microalbuminuria and proteinuria, pulmonary function, assess the effects of anti-VEGF therapy by assessing brachial artery reactivity, retinal vasculature and pulmonary function in a subset of patients receiving anti-VEGF therapy. The development of markers of endothelial dysfunction may result in the early identification of patients who are non-responders or develop toxicity from anti-VEGF treatment.

The current, standard treatment is Ulnar nerve decompression with or without transposition (moving the ulnar nerve to a site where there is less compression). In severe compression, the clinical results after this surgery are typically poor. Distal transfers of functioning nerves (at the level of the wrist) to the compressed ulnar nerve (anterior interosseous nerve to ulnar motor fascicles) have been suggested to "supercharge" or augment hand muscles while nerve axons regenerate from the level of the elbow after decompression/transposition. In fact, this treatment is becoming widely adopted without clear evidence that it changes outcomes. The investigators propose to prospectively compare the effectiveness of ulnar nerve decompression/transposition versus decompression/transposition and distal nerve transfer.

Acute kidney injury is a common and serious postoperative complication of cardiopulmonary bypass and may affect 25% to 50% of patients (2-4). Acute kidney injury carries significant costs (4) and is independently associated with increased morbidity and mortality (2,3). Even minimal increments in plasma creatinine are associated with an increase in mortality (5,6).  Multiple causes of cardiopulmonary bypass-associated acute kidney injury have been proposed, including ischemia-reperfusion, generation of reactive oxygen species, hemolysis and activation of inflammatory pathways (7-10). COMT LL genotype appears to increase the risk of vasodilatory shock and AKI after cardiac surgery. To date, no simple, safe and effective intervention to prevent cardiopulmonary bypass-associated acute kidney injury in a broad patient population has been found (11-14).  Urinary acidity may enhance the generation and toxicity of reactive oxygen species induced by cardiopulmonary bypass (10,15). Activation of complement during cardiac surgery (16) may also participate in kidney injury. Urinary alkalinization may protect from kidney injury induced by oxidant substances, iron-mediated free radical pathways, complement activation and tubular hemoglobin cast formation (9,17,18). Of note, increasing urinary pH - in combination with N-acetylcysteine (19,20) or without (21) - has recently been reported to attenuate acute kidney injury in patients undergoing contrast-media infusion.  In a pilot double-blind, randomized controlled trial the investigators found sodium bicarbonate to be efficacious, safe, inexpensive and easy to administer. These findings now need to be confirmed or refuted by further clinical investigations in other geographic and institutional settings.  Accordingly, the investigators hypothesized that urinary alkalinization might protect kidney function in patients at increased risk of acute kidney injury undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass needs to be confirmed in an international multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial of intravenous sodium bicarbonate.

Of note, increasing urinary pH - in combination with N-acetylcysteine (19,20) or without (21) - has recently been reported to attenuate acute kidney injury in patients undergoing contrast-media infusion.  In a pilot double-blind, randomized controlled trial the investigators found sodium bicarbonate to be efficacious, safe, inexpensive and easy to administer. These findings now need to be confirmed or refuted by further clinical investigations in other geographic and institutional settings.  Accordingly, the investigators hypothesized that urinary alkalinization might protect kidney function in patients at increased risk of acute kidney injury undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass needs to be confirmed in an international multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial of intravenous sodium bicarbonate.

PCOS is a common endocrine disorder in young women. The pathogenesis behind PCOS is complex and only partly understood, and deeper mechanistic insight is needed. Insulin resistance is a central feature of PCOS, and recent studies have suggested that this is linked to aberrant adipose tissue function. Exercise training has been found to improve the symptoms in PCOS, but we need more knowledge about why. While processes involved in skeletal muscle oxidative remodeling are well described, it is to a large extent unknown whether the oxidative capacity of human adipose tissue is modified by endurance training. The women included in this study will be matched (for body mass index, body weight, and age) to participants in another study. This will enable the investigators to do a comparison between cases (women with PCOS) and controls (women without PCOS) at baseline, and to assess the responses to exercise training in adipose tissue.

ROS	Terminated	Local Anaesthetic Following Hernia Repair	Inguinal Hernias	Drug: Ropivicaine	                Phase 1              	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00471692?term=ROS&rank=503	NCT00471692	Inguinal hernia repair is a common surgical procedure. The major current debates revolve around laparoscopic hernia repair. The most recent Cochrane review concluded that laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair was associated with less post operative and chronic pain, shorter convalescence and earlier return to work when compared to open repair (McCormack K, Scott NW, Go PM, Ross S, Grant AM. EU hernia trialist collaboration. Laparoscopic techniques versus open techniques for inguinal hernia repair. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2003; 1(CD001785.). However, laparoscopic repair has not gained wide acceptance. It is more expensive, technically difficult for the inexperienced surgeon, is associated with rare but potentially more hazardous procedure related complications (Lo CH, Trotter D, Grossberg P. Unusual complications of laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair. ANZ journal of Surgery 2005 Oct, 75(10): 917 - 919.) and unlike open repair, requires a general anaesthetic. Critics state that laparoscopic repair is not suitable for all general surgeons and should be restricted to experts. Two prospective studies have shown that a longer laparoscopic learning curve exists when compared to open surgery. Up to 200 laparoscopic procedures are required to achieve a recurrence rate comparable to open mesh repair. (Bittner R, Schmedt CG, Schwarz J, Kraft K, Leigl BJ. Laparoscopic transperitoneal procedure for routine repair of groin hernia British journal of Surgery 2002 89; 1062 - 1066.) A meta-analysis and large multicentre randomised study have added to these concerns by demonstrating a higher recurrence rate with laparoscopic repair. (Memon MA, Cooper NJ, Memon B, Memon MI, Abrams KR. Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing open and laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. British journal of Surgery 2003; 90: 1479 - 1492. Neumayer L, Giobbie-Hurder, Jonasson O, Fitzgibbons R, Dunlop D, Gibbs J et al. Open mesh versus laparoscopic mesh repair of inguinal hernias. New England Journal of Medicine 2004; 350: 1819 - 1827.). Over the period 1998 to 2003, in Denmark, the frequency of laparoscopic repair remained constant at 4.5 - 8.0%, the laparoscopic approach being used more frequently for bilateral hernia repairs and recurrent hernia repairs. There was a higher re-operation rate following laparoscopic repair of bilateral inguinal hernias compared to bilateral open hernia repair. (Wara P, Bay-Nielsen M, Juul P, bendix J, Kehlet H. Prospective nationwide analysis of laparoscopic versus Lichenstein repair of inguinal hernia. British Journal of Surgery 2005 92(10); 1277 - 1281.)  Given these issues, a considerable number of adult inguinal hernia repairs will continue to be performed using the open technique. There is the opportunity to improve the results of open repair by potentially improving post operative pain and chronic pain. One method may be to perform an ilio inguinal nerve block. However, this procedure can be complicated by femoral nerve palsy, colonic or small bowel puncture and pelvic haematomas (Johr M, Sossai R. Colonic puncture during ilioinguinal nerve block in a child. Anesth Analg 1999 88 1051 - 1052, Amory C, mariscal A, Guyot E et al.

It also has a failure rate of 20 - 30% (Lim SL, Ng SB, Tan GM. Ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block revisited; single shot versus double shot technique for hernia repair in children. Paediatr Anaesth 2002; 12; 255 - 260.) The aim of our study is therefore to assess the role of ilio inguinal nerve block in adult patients undergoing primary inguinal hernia repair.

The original IYG program was designed for students in Houston middle schools to help students delay sexual initiation and if sexually active, use condoms and contraception. The present study will adapt the existing IYG program for an AI/AN youth cohort; the original IYG curriculum will be transferred into a web-based format and modified to incorporate additional culturally-relevant components. The primary hypothesis to be tested is: (1) students who receive the web-based curriculum will delay sexual activity relative to those who receive standard care. The major dependent variable is the proportion of students initiating sexual activity. Secondary hypotheses will examine the effect of the web-based curriculum on specific types of sex and psychosocial variables related to sexual risk-taking behavior. This project will also examine the effect of the intervention on the proportion of students who are sexually active, number of times students engage in unprotected sexual intercourse, and students' number of sexual partners.

ROS	Unknown  	U Clip Study - Study to Compare U Clip Anastomosis With Conventional Continuous Prolene Anastomosis	Haemodialysis	Device: U Clip;   Procedure: Conventional prolene anastomosis	                Phase 1                Phase 2              	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00829153?term=ROS&rank=502	NCT00829153	The requirements for haemodialysis are increasing. There is now acceptance that the most durable AV fistulae are those created from the patients own veins. Use of the radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula as an autologous vascular access dates back to the 1960's. (Brescia MJ, Cimino JE. Appel K, Hurwich BJ. Chronic hemodialysis using venipuncture and a surgically created arteriovenous fistula. N Engl J Med 1966; 275: 1089 - 1092.) Once established, it has good long term survival and a low complication rate. However, the success rate at creation of a useable AV fistula are not good. In a meta-analysis published in 2005, the primary failure rate of a radiocephalic fistula was 15.3% and the primary and secondary patency rates were 62.5% and 66.0% at one year. (Rooijens PPGM, Tordoir JHM, Stijnen T, Burgmans JPJ, Smet AAEA and Yo TI. Radiocephalic wrist arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis: meta-analysis indicates a high primary failure rate. Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg 2004; 28, 583-589). Reasons for this are multiple but it appears as though the main determinants are the quality of the patients veins and the technical skill of the surgeon. Low patency rates are also seen in females and those with small veins and arteries. Creating an anastomosis between a small vein and artery is technically challenging. This is traditionally preformed with a continuous prolene suture. Recently, Medtronic have been marketing the U Clip Anastomotic Device. This is a self closing devise which could be called a vascular clip. Reported advantages of this clip include better patency rates and faster operations. However, to our knowledge there is no randomised evidence to support this with regards to AV fistulas.  The vascular anastomosis originally developed by Alexis Carrel used interrupted sutures. Over time this was replaced by a continuous suture technique which was felt to be quicker and had similar patency rates. However, microvascular, paediatric and neurovascular surgeons have shown that there are advantages to an interrupted technique. (Hattori H, Killen DA, Green JW. Influence of suture material and technic on patency of anastomosed arteries of less than 1.5mm. Am Surg. 1970; 36: 352 - 354. Cobbett JR. Microvascular surgery. Surg Clin N Am. 1962; 47: 521.). The reasons for the improved patency with interrupted anastomoses are firstly increased anastomotic compliance and flow rate and secondly elimination of the pursestring effect and puckering seen with continuous sutures.  In a prospective but non randomised study to compare interrupted U clips with historical published results, the patency rate of coronary anastomoses was 100% at 6 months using the U clips compare to a patency rate of 90 -100% in the published series. (Wolf RK, Alderman EL, Caskey MP et al. Clinical and six month angiographic evaluation of coronary arterial graft interrupted anastomoses by use of a self closing clip device: a multicentre prospective clinical trial. J Thorac cardiovasc Surg 2003; 126(1): 168 - 178.)  Reports from single centres have concluded that the U Clips offer the opportunity to create superior interrupted anastomoses for AV fistula, even in patients who would otherwise be considered poor candidates for fistula creation. (Ross JR. Creation of native arteriovenous fistulas with interrupted anastomoses using a self closing clip device - one clinics experience. Journal of vascular Access 2002; 3: 140 - 146). In this report with small numbers, the radiocephalic fistulas had an 8 week maturation rate of 93%. Of the 28 patients having a radiocephalic fistula, 10 had veins of between 1.0 - 1,5mm diameter.  The aim of this pilot study will be to assess if there is a clinical difference in the maturation rates of autologous AV fistulae when a clipped anastomosis is compared to a conventional prolene anastomosis.

Rosacea is also a a recurring skin disorder. In addition to causing uncomfortable and embarrassing physical symptoms such as flushing, burning, and itching, rosacea can also contribute to lower self-esteem, which can have a significant psychosocial impact on quality of life. Rosacea flares can be triggered by every day factors such as sun exposure, heat, hot or caffeinated drinks, alcoholic beverages, spices and stress.  Many of the currently available treatments for rosacea are only partially effective and some patients do not respond to them, or are unable to tolerate the side effects.  This is a single-center, open label trial of Apremilast in ten (10) subjects with moderate to severe inflammatory rosacea who will be treated with Apremilast 20 mg twice per day for 12 weeks. Following the screening period and baseline visit, study subjects will return at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. There is a follow up study visit at week 16.  Recent research has shown an increase of specific proinflammatory cytokines in the biopsies of inflammatory lesions from rosacea and acne patients. The cytokines then trigger a chain of chemical responses in the body that likely result in the development of the papules an pustules that are seen in rosacea and acne patients. Apremilast is an oral agent that modulates multiple anti-inflammatory pathways and has pharmacodynamic properties with potential therapeutic benefit for treating inflammatory autoimmune disorders.  The investigators therefore propose a pilot study to evaluate the potential for Apremilast to improve the signs and symptoms of moderate to severe inflammatory rosacea.

It also carries a financial burden on the Canadian economy with a yearly cost close to $21 billion divided between loss of productivity and healthcare costs. The majority of cardiovascular disease cases (90%) are caused by factors that can be controlled and modified. These factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes (high blood sugar), tobacco smoking, unhealthy diet, obesity, physical inactivity and high alcohol consumption. Such factors are very common and not very well controlled and so individuals who have any of these factors would be at risk of having cardiovascular disease. As such controlling these factors will reduce the risk of having cardiovascular disease and improve the individuals' quality of life. Pharmacists frequently work with patients and their family doctor to provide cardiovascular care. Having a pharmacist involved in cardiovascular care may help patients with cardiovascular disease or at risk of having the disease because they are more accessible and may have more opportunities to educate people about cardiovascular medications. This might lead to better prevention and control of cardiovascular disease.  Purpose:  The research study will assess if a community pharmacy cardiovascular risk reduction intervention can help reduce cardiovascular risk.  Procedure:  If the individual has an elevated blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, waist circumference or body weight or is physically inactive, have an unhealthy diet, a smoker or taking medications for any of the previously mentioned conditions, the pharmacist will assess the cardiovascular disease risk [risk of having a cardiovascular event (e.g. heart attack or a stroke)] using a computer program. If the individual is at high risk s/he will be asked to take part in the study.  If the individual agrees to take part in the study s/he will be randomly assigned to either the Usual Care Group or the Advanced Care Group. All participants have an equal chance of being assigned to either group. If assigned to the Usual Care Group, the individual will receive the care and services that would normally be provided by the pharmacist. At 3 months, the pharmacist will see the individual who will be offered the Advanced Care at that time.  If assigned to the to Advanced Care Group, the individual will be asked to meet with the pharmacist every 3-4 weeks over a 3 month period. During these meetings, the pharmacist will conduct an assessment that may include blood pressure, waist circumference, height and weight measurements and talk to the individual about their cardiovascular risk and medications. The individual and the pharmacist will come up with a plan for how to try to lower his/her cardiovascular risk. The pharmacist will discuss this plan with their family doctor. The individual will be asked to conduct some laboratory tests before the 3 months visit; these tests may include HbA1c (a blood test to measure blood sugar control over the last 3 months) and cholesterol to assess the effect of the intervention on cardiovascular risk.

The Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS) framework suggests that for knowledge translation to be effective, there must be evidence of benefit, a context conducive to implementation, and facilitation to support uptake. We hypothesize that while the evidence and context components of this framework are satisfied, that uptake into practice has been insufficient because of a lack of facilitation. This protocol describes the rationale and methods of a feasibility study to test a facilitated pharmacy practice intervention based on the PARiHS framework, to assist community pharmacists in increasing the number of formal and documented medication management services completed for patients with diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.  Methods: A cluster-randomized before-after design will compare ten pharmacies from within a single organization, with the unit of randomization being the pharmacy. Pharmacies will be randomized to facilitated intervention based on the PARiHS framework or usual practice. The Alberta Context Tool will be used to establish the context of practice in each pharmacy. Pharmacies randomized to the intervention will receive task-focused facilitation from an external facilitator, with the goal of developing alternative team processes to allow the greater provision of medication management services for patients with diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The primary outcome will be a process evaluation of the needs of community pharmacies to provide more clinical services, the acceptability and uptake of modifications made, and the willingness of pharmacies to participate. Secondary outcomes will include the change in the number of formal and documented medication management services in the aforementioned chronic conditions provided 6 months before, versus after, the intervention between the two groups, and identification of feasible quantitative outcomes for evaluating the effect of the intervention on patient care outcomes.  Results: To date, the study has identified and enrolled the ten pharmacies required and initiated the intervention process.  Conclusion: This study will be the first to examine the role of facilitation in pharmacy practice, with the goal of scalable and sustainable practice change.

ROS	Terminated	Beneficial Effects of Exercise and Healthy Diets on Muscle and Adipose Tissue	Metabolic Syndrome	Behavioral: Control period;   Behavioral: Diet Group;   Behavioral: Exercise group;   Behavioral: Diet + Exercise		https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01793896?term=ROS&rank=444	NCT01793896	Both dietary caloric restriction (CR) and physical exercise (PE) exert beneficial effects, which retard or prevent age-related diseases and prolong life span. Subjects with the metabolic syndrome age prematurely, therefore preventive measures should be initiated early. The present study intends to demonstrate that physical exercise and/or Mediterranean diet, in middle aged volunteers with the metabolic syndrome, preserve adequate adipose tissue functionality and retard skeletal muscle aging (assessed by mitochondrial biogenesis and accumulation of ROS), by activating several pathways, homologous to CR. The investigators plan to study this by using two approaches: 1) A cross- sectional model, in which the expression of the mentioned metabolic mediators, indicators of muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and muscle oxidative damage will be compared between men with different body compositions, fat distribution, muscle strength and exercise capacity (VO2max). Also, in these men the investigators will assess the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (as a measure of adaptive thermogenesis), and inflammatory markers (Interleukin 1-6, Interleukin 1  and CCL2 chemokine (C-C motif ligand 2)) in preperitoneal adipose tissue, plus inflammation and adipogenesis potential of their cultured preadipocytes. Moreover, in vitro studies will evaluate the functional effects of exposure of a cell lyne of human adipocyte cells (LS14)to factors secreted by media conditioned by the patients  adipose tissue explants. 2) A prospective intervention in overweight/moderately obese middle aged volunteers that will be assigned to a weight-maintenance period (as a control group), and then randomly y assigned to a Mediterranean diet, exercise training or diet plus training. Before and after 3 months of intervention the investigators will obtain muscle tissue samples to study the expression of Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1), uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3), AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), Sirtuin 1 (SIRT-1), mitochondrial DNA and oxidative damage indicators (8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2-deoxyguanosine (oxodG), carboxymethyllysine (CML and its receptor (RAGE)). In vitro studies will evaluate the effect of circulating factors from the patients (serum) on LS14 inflammatory and adipogenic potential, at baseline and after 3 months of intervention.

ROS	Recruiting	Is Peri-operative Hyperoxemia a Risk Factor for Postoperative Complications 	Vascular Disease	Drug: Oxygen;   Other: Air	                Phase 3              martin-svahn@orebroll.se	https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02562781?term=ROS&rank=442	NCT02562781	Patients undergoing vascular surgery are at a significantly high risk of perioperative cardiovascular, cerebral and renal events compared to those undergoing non-vascular surgery. This could be because of co-morbidities that are common in this patient group. Additionally, smoking, which is common in this population, may be a contributing factor.  Oxygen therapy has been used for decades in order to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke in patients undergoing vascular surgery and pre-existing co-morbidities in the belief that increased inspired oxygen increases oxygen delivery to tissues, thereby reducing the risk for hypoxia and cell death. However, several studies published recently have questioned the routine use of high inspired oxygen concentration (hyperoxia) to improve oxygen delivery, specifically in the neonatal period but possibly even following myocardial infarction. This could be explained by the fact that increasing inspired concentrations of oxygen cause vasoconstriction in cerebral and coronary arteries, thereby reducing blood flow. Additionally, increased oxygen causes excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and repercussion injury from oxidative stress. The latter can lead to apoptosis (cell death) in myocardial or cerebral neurons. Despite the high risks of administering oxygen when not needed, it is routinely used in hospitals all over the world without a doctors prescription.  This study aims to assess peri-operative complications up to 1 year following vascular surgery in patients randomised to receive high inspired oxygen concentration (endpoint: SpO2 98 - 100%) or minimal inspired O2 concentration (endpoint: SpO2 > 90%).

The concept of fatty acid impairment of glucose stimulated insulin secretion (lipotoxicity) has now been well accepted. Increased free fatty acid flux from adipose tissue to non-adipose tissue, resulting from abnormalities of fat metabolism, participates in and amplifies many of the metabolic derangements that are characteristic of insulin resistance syndrome and type 2 diabetes.  Lipotoxicity is also likely to play an important role in the progression from normal glucose tolerance to fasting hyperglycemia and conversion to frank type 2 diabetes in insulin resistant individuals. This area of research is now focused on determining the mechanisms whereby FFAs impair b-cell function. There is some evidence to suggest that lipotoxicity could be mediated through induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a known potent antioxidant and has been used experimentally in a number of medical conditions in humans for its protective antioxidant effects. The investigators now plan to administer NAC orally to humans for 48 hours to examine the effects of antioxidant therapy in ameliorating the deleterious effects of FFAs on pancreatic beta cell function. NAC is currently approved for the treatment of acetaminophen overdose and is also used as a mucolytic agent. The investigators are now using NAC as an antioxidant to determine whether it protects the pancreatic beta cell against the toxic effects of FFAs, as outlined in the detailed study protocol. This is a proof-of-principle study and is not designed to develop n-acetylcysteine for therapeutic use.	Canada, Ontario || University Health Network || Toronto, Ontario, Canada, M5G 2C4	[]

In previous study, the investigators successfully induced AKI animal model. IS enhanced intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression in IL-1¦Â-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) that this may play a critical role in the progression of AKI. However, the molecular mechanisms of ICAM-1 expression in IS-treated IL-1¦Â-treated HUVECs need to be elucidated. HUVECs incubated with 0.2 or 1 mM IS for 24 h did not cause cytotoxicity. The IL-1¦Â-induced ICAM-1 expression in HUVECs was significantly enhanced by IS pretreatment. Furthermore, the regulation of adhesion molecule expression involves a complex array of intracellular signaling pathways including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and transcriptional factors. A better understanding of this might provide important insights into the prevention of AKI.

These patients also manifest a decrease in nitric oxide (NO) availability which is thought to play an important role in their progressive vascular disease.  Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an essential cofactor for endothelial nitric oxide synthase(eNOS), an important regulator of NO and that is a key mediator of endothelial dysfunction. Changes in NO availability are believed to contribute to endothelial dysfunction seen in CKD and common CVD states. 6R-tetrahydrobiopterin (6R-BH4 or sapropterin dihydrochloride) is an investigational oral drug that is being evaluated to determine whether it will restore NO availability, leading to beneficial effects on vascular function and ultimately positive clinical outcomes in patients with CKD. The primary endpoint in this study is the level of albuminuria, an easily measured marker that has served as a predictor of kidney disease progression. If 6R-BH4 reduces albuminuria in patients with kidney disease, it may have implications to slow the disease progression as well as decreased risk of CVD.

By comparing gene expression between normal lung tissue and tumors growing in lung-specific C/EBPa KO mice, the investigators have identified the Bmi-1 proto-oncogene as being abnormally upregulated in C/EBPa-deleted tumors. Subsequently, the investigators have validated this observation in human lung cancer, implicating the investigators KO mice are an effective discovery tool for lung cancer research. Through similar approaches, the investigators have already identified (Sonic Hedgehog, SHH), and plan to identify other pathways which are abnormally regulated in C/EBPa-/- tumors. In parallel, the investigators will proceed to define the clinical relevance of the SHH pathway and the other newly-discovered molecular aberrations, by analyzing their expression and correlate it to C/EBPa expression on the samples of patients with NSCLC at NUHS. If the investigators preliminary data on Bmi-1 will be confirmed, this proto-oncogene may generate useful correlates that could be used in diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer, as well as identify new prognostic/predictive markers in lung cancer. Similarly, SHH pathway-components may behave as potential biomarkers and therapeutic tools for C/EBPa-related lung cancers.  This proposal seeks to test the hypothesis that pathways which are dysregulated in lung tumors growing in a lung-specific C/EBPa KO model can be utilized as discovery tools to identify genes involved in human lung cancer pathogenesis.

This position has certain advantages compared to alternative surgical positions (e.g. side lying) in some situations. However, it has been found that surgery in the BCP can temporarily decrease the amount of oxygen in the brain as a result of the combined effects of gravity and anaesthesia. This can result in complications following surgery such as some memory loss and confusion. Rarely, more serious complications have been reported in the past including death and stroke.  Due to these reported complications the use of "cerebral oximetry" during shoulder surgery in the BCP has become more common. Before and during surgery, a monitor placed on the patients forehead measures the amount of oxygen present in the brain to help control this to an acceptable level. A number of monitors are now commercially available. Two monitors are commonly discussed in the literature; the INVOS  5100 and the FORE-SIGHT  machines. However, the actual relationship between the supply of oxygen to the brain during surgery and the chance of later developing problems with memory and thinking (known as "post operative cognitive decline" - POCD) is not clear. It is also not known if one monitor is more accurate than another at predicting these complications.  Therefore, the main aim of this study is to examine the relationship between cerebral oxygen levels during shoulder surgery and the incidence of POCD (i.e. problems with memory and thinking). A second aim is to compare the INVOS  5100 and FORE-SIGHT  monitors ability to measure cerebral oxygen and cerebral desaturation events (CDEs) as well as the importance of other key clinical variables (e.g. blood pressure, nausea, body fat etc).

Our previous data confirmed strong HO-1 induction in peripheral blood cells following heme arginate infusion in healthy humans5. Furthermore, we could demonstrate the amelioration of experimental ischemia reperfusion injury in the calf musculature by heme arginate in healthy subjects as measured by functional MRI6.  Therefore, we propose that HO-1 induction in the human heart may be a suitable target to mitigate cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury.  The HO-1 induction will be assessed in a clinical trial by myocardial biopsy prior to and after aortic cross clamping in subjects with or without preceding heme arginate treatment in two different dosages. The HO-1 expression will also be measured in the clinical trials in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. As additional outcome, levels of myoglobin, creatine-kinase and troponin T and reactive oxygen species will be measured in plasma according to standard laboratory procedures.

A non-union is a lack of bone healing (bone growth where the break in the bone occurred) after 3 months after the operation. The diaphyseal is an area of a specific bone (usually near the middle) where the fracture occurred. The bones we are interested in are the clavicle (collar bone), tibia (lower leg), femur (upper leg), humerus (upper arm) and forearm (lower arm). Treatment goals for these types of fractures are to minimize later surgeries, to assist the healing process, and to decrease the time to healing. The ability of a patient with non-union (lack of bone healing after 3 months post operation) to return to the work force and to normal activities more quickly not only has a good financial impact on society (community), but also improves over-all physical and mental well-being of the patients.  "Infuse" is a synthetic bone morphogenic protein which means it has the ability to help your bone to form and heal if inserted in the fracture site. "Infuse" may be the first commercially available product approved by Health Canada to accelerate the healing of long bone non-unions requiring surgical intervention.  Although the safety and efficacy of Infuse has been demonstrated through numerous pre-clinical studies, further human clinical trial is needed to evaluate the safety and the power to produce effects of this product particularly with respect to non unions of long bones. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the power to produce effects of Infuse implanted during treatment of long bone non unions to reduce later surgeries required to augment the healing process and to accelerate the time to healing.  Given this, the orthopaedic community has planned this study in order to scientifically establish the most effective treatment method to restore function after this type of injury.

Females and young children are disproportionately affected as they either perform or are present for the majority of cooking activities. Worldwide, household air pollution is responsible for 1.6 million premature deaths annually, largely secondary to respiratory tract infections, and 2.7% of worldwide disability-adjusted life years. Children that survive childhood are not free from disease; the WHO estimates that 35% of COPD cases worldwide are secondary to household air pollution. Reducing female and infant morbidity and mortality related to household air pollution secondary to biomass smoke exposure is a top-priority public health goal.  We hypothesize that in utero biomass smoke exposure results in a fetal oxidant imbalance, which negatively impacts lung development. We will leverage the success of the Ghana Randomized Air Pollution and Health Study, a randomized cook stove intervention trial of 1,415 mother-infant pairs, to examine the impact of maternal household air pollution exposure on cord blood oxidant imbalance and infant pulmonary function. We aim to enroll at least 150 infants, analyze cord blood samples for markers of oxidant imbalance and perform infant pulmonary function testing. Cord blood will also be prepared for future immune, hormonal and epigenetic testing. This study will allow us to consider interventions, such as maternal antioxidant dietary supplementation during pregnancy, to compliment existing cook stove interventions and reduce household air pollution-related morbidity and mortality.

One of the common side-effects of this drug is bilateral, symmetric, progressive and usually irreversible sensorineural hearing loss.  Cisplatin induces cochlear toxicity by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).  Dexamethasone treatment is currently practiced for various pathologies afflicting the inner ear. The positive effect of Dexamethasone is attributed to it's anti ROS activity and it's capability to up-regulate cochlear anti ROS enzymes.  In order to reach higher inner ear concentration of the drug while avoiding it's undesirable systemic side-effects, Intratympanic (IT) delivery of Dexamethasone became vastly used in the last decades for the treatment of sudden sensorineural hearing loss and Meniere's disease.  Dexamethasone inserted IT, diffuse across the round window into the inner ear perilymph where it exerts its therapeutic effects.  The investigators review of the literature yielded three animal studies which examined the protective effect of IT dexamethasone in the prevention of cisplatin-induced hearing loss. These studies demonstrated promising results pointing to the potential for IT dexamethasone in the prevention of cisplatin ototoxicity in humans.  The purpose of this study is to examine possible protective effect of IT dexamethasone on cisplatin-induced hearing loss, in humans.  The study hypothesis is that IT dexamethasone treatment would prevent cisplatin-induced hearing loss.

Its free thiol group is capable of interacting with the electrophilic groups of ROS. This interaction with ROS leads to intermediate formation of NAC thiol, with NAC disulphide as a major end product. The net result is a decrease of the concentrations of OH-, H2O2, and HOCl. In addition, NAC exerts an indirect antioxidant effect related to its role as a glutathione (GSH) precursor. It serves as a central factor in protecting against internal toxic agents.

ROS	Completed	Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet and Circulating Levels of Sirtuin 4 in Obese Subjects	Mediterranean Diet;   Nutrition;   Sirtuin 4;   Obesity			https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02840981?term=ROS&rank=342	NCT02840981	The Mediterranean diet (MD), a healthy dietary pattern based on some common dietary characteristics in Mediterranean countries, is associated with high antioxidant capacity linked to the low saturated fat intake that might contribute to reduce free fatty acid (FFA) availability and oxidation in mitochondria, thus reducing the production of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) superoxide, and promoting cellular health. To assess the adherence to the MD, a simple 14-item questionnaire had been tested in different settings by the PREDIMED (PREvenci¨®n con DIeta MEDiterr¨¢nea) multicenter, randomized, primary prevention trial. On the other hand, to allow a more an accurate measurement of the actual macro and micronutrient intakes, including dietary anti-oxidant micronutrients, the 7-day food records is considered as the "gold standard" of self-administered food frequency questionnaires.  Circulating levels of Sirtuin 4 (Sirt4), part of a complex of proteins that control diverse biological processes, including lipid metabolism, are low in obese patients, as a possible attempt to decrease fat oxidative capacity and mitochondrial ROS production, however promoting ectopic liver fat storage.  The phase angle (PA), a measure determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and the visceral adiposity index (VAI), a gender-specific mathematical index based on simple anthropometric and metabolic parameters, represent well-validated, reliable and widely used markers of cellular health and ectopic adipose distribution and function, respectively. The fatty liver index (FLI) is a surrogate measure for fatty liver recently proposed as an independent predictor for diabetes mellitus.  Aim of the present study was to investigate in adult obese individuals the levels of Sirt4 according to the adherence to the MD evaluated by PREDIMED questionnaire, focusing on the possible association with single dietary components evaluated by 7-day food records, and to evaluate the association between circulating levels of Sirt4 and PA, as marker of cellular health, VAI, as index of adipocyte dysfunction, and FLI, as a predictor of fatty liver.

Research has shown that high blood sugar increases the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in diabetics, and that the increase in ROS causes damage to eyes, kidneys, and nerves by a process called "oxidative stress." We postulate that alpha-lipoic acid, a potent anti-oxidant, can stop ROS from forming, thereby preventing long-term complications in diabetes. In this pilot study, we will be giving 30 teenagers with type 1 diabetes (T1D) controlled-release alpha-lipoic acid for 3 months, and comparing the amount of oxidative stress before and after treatment.

ROS	Recruiting	"Effect of High Fat and High Glycemic Diets	Type 2 Diabetes	Behavioral: High Glycemic Diet;   Behavioral: Control diet		https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01494935?term=ROS&rank=326	NCT01494935	The investigators will determine whether people with high muscle mitochondrial capacity produce higher amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on consuming high fat /high glycemic diet and thus exhibit elevated cellular oxidative damage. The investigators previously found that Asian Indian immigrants have high mitochondrial capacity in spite of severe insulin resistance. Somalians are another new immigrant population with rapidly increasing prevalence of diabetes. Both of these groups traditionally consume low caloric density diets, and the investigators hypothesize that when these groups are exposed to high-calorie Western diets, they exhibit increased oxidative stress, oxidative damage, and insulin resistance. The investigators will compare Somalians and NE Americans who are matched for age, BMI, and sex. The investigators will measure ROS production in skeletal muscle following high fat/high glycemic diet vs. healthy diet. The investigators will compare the oxidative damage to proteins, DNA, and lipids in these two populations following 10 days of high fat/high glycemic index diet in comparison with low fat diet. The investigators will determine if elevated levels of oxidative damage in Somali immigrant populations is accompanied by high mitochondrial capacity, higher ROS-emitting potential, and lower insulin sensitivity than NE. The proposed study will be performed utilizing the state-of-the-art proteomic and metabolomic methods many of which were recently developed in our laboratory. The investigators expect the results from this study to provide seminal insights into the underlying mechanism of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, in addition to demonstrating mechanisms by which a functional proteome is maintained in vivo.

ROS	Completed	Physical Fitness Effect on the Different Oxidative Stress Measurements	Oxidative Stress	Other: Stress test		https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01296490?term=ROS&rank=328	NCT01296490	Physical exercise has many benefits, although it might also have negative impact on the body, which changes in accordance with training level, length of workout, age of subject and their fitness level. These outcomes are governed by complex biological processes, from which Reactive Oxygen Substances (ROS) are considered the most prominent ones during exercise activity. These substances harm muscle activity, and might cause other health related damage by influencing other pathways that engage with free radicals. Excess of ROS, is expressed as Oxidative Stress (OS), pathogenic process activation and aging. With this in mind, it is important to remember that ROS are essential to the investigators bodies as well, especially in gene regulation. Thus they influence proteins that are important for proper muscle function and the immune system.  Physical exercise induces changes in low molecular weight antioxidants, and in antioxidant enzymes. According to results that were published in the literature, no universal conclusion can be made regarding physical exercise effect on antioxidants activity. These contradictions might be attributed to the difference between the methods that were used, and their quality.  Paradoxically, physical exercise has the same effect on ROS inducement in skeletal muscle fibers as does not using the muscles for a long period of time (especially as a result of handicap). It is well known that physical exercise effect oxidative stress and antioxidant. Due to the doubts that rise from the literature, the investigators think that it is important to test physical fitness effect on oxidative stress biological markers, using various high quality methods, on the same population.  The investigators will test healthy men, 20-35 years of age, none smokers with 6-24% fat, who do not take vitamins or supplements. The men will run on a treadmill for 10 minutes to exhaustion, and blood will be taken before the test, 5 minutes after the test, and an hour after the test (checking recovery).

Consequently, a complete efficacious treatment is still not available. Earlier studies indicate an important key role for oxidative stress, i.e. an imbalance between the production of and the protection against ROS, in the etiology of sarcoidosis. Antioxidants, needed for protection against ROS, are indeed lower in sarcoidosis. Therefore, antioxidant therapy to strengthen the reduced antioxidant defense might be efficacious in sarcoidosis treatment. Since ROS are also capable of initiating and mediating inflammation, antioxidant therapy might also mitigate the elevated inflammation that occurs in sarcoidosis. The flavonoid quercetin possesses both anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory capacities and might therefore serve as a good candidate for antioxidant therapy in sarcoidosis.  Therefore, the aim of the present study is to determine the effect of quercetin supplementation in sarcoidosis patients on markers of both oxidative stress and inflammation.

In a myriad of possible mechanisms that cause periodontal tissue destruction reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role. Imbalance between antioxidant defense system of body and ROS lead to a deleterious situation called oxidative stress.  Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is the key enzyme of body's antioxidant defense system whereas malondialdehyde (MDA) is product of lipid peroxidation due to ROS. Free radicals and ROS have short half lives in vivo of 10-6 to 10-9 seconds. Hence measurement of ROS is done by measuring the concentration of biomarkers of tissue destruction.  For treating periodontal disease, conventional mechanical therapy comprising of scaling and root planing (SRP) along with timely maintenance has been a gold standard and any other therapy considered for treating periodontitis should always be used as an adjunctive and never in lieu of it.  Curcumin, a hydrophobic polyphenol, is a principal active constituent of turmeric. Mechanism of action of curcumin is twofold-its role as a strong antioxidant and as a strong antibacterial. Its analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties offer additional benefits.Periodontitis is a chronic disease of oral cavity accompanied by increased oxidative stress. Therefore the clinical application of a natural antioxidant in the form of curcuma longa can be beneficial in reducing oxidative stress and as an adjuvant in treatment of chronic periodontitis.

Method: After a 2-week screening period, adult patients (aged 36-72 years) entered a 4-week run-in/stabilization period. Then, patients were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n=55) or control group (n=50) for 26 weeks. The patients in the control group were given metformin (1,000 mg, bid po) and the patients in the intervention group were given metformin (500 mg, bid po) combined with alogliptin (25 mg, qd po). All the patients received counseling about diet and exercise from a nutritionist during run-in and treatment periods.  The primary endpoints were the between-group differences in the changes pulmonary function parameters [VC%, FVC%, FEV1%, PEF%, MVV%, TLC%, FEV1/FVC%, DLCO%, and DLCO/VA%] between pretherapy and posttreatment. The secondary endpoints were changes from baseline to week 26 in HbA1c, FPG, 2hPG, HOMA-IR, WC, and BMI. The tertiary endpoints were the changes from baseline to week 26 in blood-fat (TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG). The quartus endpoints were the changes from baseline to week 26 in SBP and DBP. The fifth endpoints were the changes from baseline to week 26 in oxidative/antioxidative parameters (ROS, MDA, SOD, and GSH-PX). In addition, safety endpoints were assessed (AEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and electrocardiographic readings).	[]	[]

Cancer cells are preferentially affected by ROS. The investigators, therefore, propose that interfering with the detoxification of ROS will make radiation more toxic to cancer cells. Several cellular mechanisms exist to detoxify ROS, and glucose metabolism plays an important role in many of these mechanisms. The investigators propose that interfering with glucose metabolism will sensitize cancer cells to radiation.  The investigators' central hypothesis is that 2DG will sensitize cancer cells to ionizing radiation by inhibiting the use of glucose to detoxify reactive oxygen species produced by radiation. As an initial step to evaluate this hypothesis, the investigators have designed this phase I study.

For many years, surgical valve replacement with extracorporeal circulation has been the gold standard in the treatment of severe aortic valve diseases. Every year, about 12,000 patients in Germany receive isolated aortic valve surgery. Several alternatives to established procedures have recently emerged:              V-TAVI, vascular transcatheter aortic valve implantation and        A-TAVI, apical transcatheter aortic valve implantation. For some time, percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty has been used as a palliative measure for specific patients.            New developments have triggered assumptions that there will over the coming years be a certain reorientation to the treatment of patients with aortic valve defects. In a positioning paper published jointly by the German Cardiac Society (DGK) and the German Society for Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (DGTHG), there is a consensus that these new techniques can be used on patients who have either contraindications against conventional surgery or who are at high risk of preoperative mortality, e.g. due to severe comorbidities.      As there is as yet only limited experience in this field and neither randomised trials nor long-term-results are available, the use of new implantation techniques is therefore not recommended for younger patients or patients without comorbidities. There is accordingly an urgent need for any introduction of this innovative medical procedure to be stringently monitored according to scientific principles. The goal of the planned Germany Aortic Valve Register is to evaluate the new treatments from the point of view of benefits und risks with respect to the gold standard of conventional surgery, with a view to compiling evidence-based indication criteria. The register will furthermore allow for the first time a comparison of various operative procedures, such as Ross procedure, David procedure and various mechanical or biological aortic valve implants.        Rationale of the study design Randomised trials in controlled environments are considered best scientific practice for verifying the efficacy of a new method. The disadvantage is that only a small part of potential patients can be included in the trial, and results therefore reflect only a small section of the real world. Furthermore, a randomised study design is for ethical reasons not an acceptable approach to all questions, especially when contraindications exist for a certain branch of treatments and the spectrum of treatments is to be expanded. Nevertheless, new procedures have to be critically and scientifically analysed if the risk-benefit ratio is to be accurately determined. National heath authorities therefore request register data in addition to controlled trials in order to verify the safety and efficacy of new procedures across larger patient populations.

There are approximately 12 visits during the 96 weeks of the study. Participants will receive a physical assessment, blood and urine tests at each visit. In addition, periodic assessments of dietary habits, body composition, oral glucose tolerance testing, and health related quality of life questionnaires will be completed.    A repeat MRI of the liver is performed at 48 weeks and at the end of the study to evaluate any potential changes in liver fat and inflammation. In addition, there is a follow-up liver biopsy at 48 weeks and an optional liver biopsy at 96 weeks.

The primary objective of the TODAY trial is to compare the efficacy of three treatment arms on time to treatment failure based on glycemic control. The secondary aims are to:      compare and evaluate the safety of the three treatment arms;    compare the effects of the three treatments on the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) with regards to beta cell function and insulin resistance, body composition, nutrition, physical activity and aerobic fitness, cardiovascular risk factors, microvascular complications, quality of life, and psychological outcomes;    evaluate the influence of individual and family behaviors on treatment response; and    compare the relative cost effectiveness of the three treatment arms.    The three treatment regimens are: (1) metformin alone, (2) metformin plus rosiglitazone, and (3) metformin plus an intensive lifestyle intervention called the TODAY Lifestyle Program (TLP). The study recruits patients over a three-year period and follows patients for a minimum of two years. Patients are randomized within two years of the diagnosis of T2D.

ROS	Unknown  	The Effect of Januvia (Sitagliptin) on Oxidative Stress in Obese Type 2 Diabetic Subjects	Type 2 Diabetes	Drug: Januvia (Sitagliptin) 100 mg;   Drug: Placebo		https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00659711?term=ROS&rank=301	NCT00659711	Sitagliptin is a new oral hypoglycemic anti-diabetic drug used either alone or in combination with metformin or a thiazolidinedione for control of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Sitagliptin has been shown to have fewer side effects in the control of blood glucose values.  Obesity and diabetes are states of increased inflammation and can influence the free radicals and inflammatory markers (chemicals in the blood which increase due to inflammation in the body) and are also major risk factors for atherosclerotic disease. In this study we want to see the effect of sitagliptin on these markers. We believe that Sitagliptin may exert an anti-inflammatory effect in the human. The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of sitagliptin to diabetic patients will provide added benefit. We believe that sitagliptin provides these added benefits by suppressing free radicals (charged substances that cause damage to the body) and inflammation.

ROS	Recruiting	Anti-inflammatory Effects of the Fiber	Type 2 Diabetes	Dietary Supplement: dietary fiber		https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02868788?term=ROS&rank=210	NCT02868788	This study will help elucidate the mechanism underlying the cardioprotective and anti-diabetes effect of dietary fiber by exploring a comprehensive set of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, based on a contemporary understanding of this process. In addition, there have been very few studies that explored the immediate change in oxidative stress and incretin secretion after fiber intake. In this study, the investigators will be able assess the short term metabolic impact of dietary fiber at great details. The result will contribute to dietary recommendation or designing of fiber supplementation for prevention/treatment of diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease.
